The record will be preceded by the lead single “Deal With It”, which is set for release on March 3rd, 2023.\nNow featuring vocals from Callum Oak the band’s sound has blossomed into a heavier, more intense machine. This album features intricate polyrhythms, broken grooves, and jagged riffs that will have you checking to make sure you haven’t broken a bone. While the album showcases the group’s heavy side, it still maintains the candidness and introspection of Chiyoda Ku’s earlier works. Chiyoda Ku are ravenous for the truth. The band went on hiatus after years of extensive touring around the UK and Europe, numerous festival appearances, van theft induced homelessness and a 3-boys-1-room living arrangement above a Bristol Dive bar. Living in different ends of the country, they were no longer talking, they had flat lined. Half way through the main world event, a faint pulse could be felt between them. After a back and forth the band decided to go for a 2 week writing holiday/lets make up session, this is where they wrote and fine tuned the album.\n<a href=\"https://chiyoda-ku.bandcamp.com/album/selecta-perspective-2\">Selecta Perspective by Chiyoda Ku</a>\nTo Celebrate the release of ‘Selecta Perspective’, Chiyoda Ku will be playing a very special release show at Strange Brew in Bristol before embarking on a tour around the UK and Europe.\nORANGE SWAN\nPost/Progressive Rock / Doom / Atmospheric Drone / Ambient\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-81813\" src=\"https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-600x399.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-600x399.jpg 600w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-768x511.jpg 768w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN.jpg 1442w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" />\nORANGE SWAN is an instrumental 4 piece from Germany and Ireland.\nBetween playful progressive rock, brutal stoner-doom riffing, atmospheric and psychedelic sounds, the German-Irish instrumental band tosses diverse perspectives on the genre (post) rock. As different as the band members are, their music also varies itself in the most different directions without losing its form. Numerous concerts with regional and international bands took them to desecrated churches, demolished industrial ruins and the finest clubs in Basel. They released several cassettes – including their debut ‘SEALED’ in 2015 – and took part in a variety of sampler contributions and furthermore cooperated with two Artzines.\nThe band stood in front of the camera for the Cardinal Sessions in 2018 and played at the Open Source Festival in the same year. In late 2019 the release of their second album ‘PERSPECTIVES’ marked another milestone, just before the times of pandemic. Since it has been possible again, they have been playing live shows again. In 2022 they opened the Traumzeit Festival.\n<a href=\"https://orangeswan.bandcamp.com/album/p-e-r-s-p-e-c-t-i-v-e-s\">p e r s p e c t i v e s by ORANGE SWAN</a>\nMission statement: Keep your ears and eyes fluid – maintain perspectives!\nCHIYODA KU, ORANGE SWAN, PSYCHIC GRAVEYARD\nBookings\nPayments can be made through iDeal / SEPA / PAYPAL / Credit Card\nTickets\nTicket price €12.00\nBooking fee €0.50Price€12,50\nSpaces\n1\n2\nRegistration Information\nTerms: I have read and agree to the Terms & Conditions\n*\nPayment and Confirmation\nI consent to my submitted data being collected and stored as outlined by the site",

The record will be preceded by the lead single <em>“Deal With It”</em>, which is set for release on March 3rd, 2023.<br>\nNow featuring vocals from <strong>Callum Oak</strong> the band’s sound has blossomed into a heavier, more intense machine. This album features intricate polyrhythms, broken grooves, and jagged riffs that will have you checking to make sure you haven’t broken a bone. While the album showcases the group’s heavy side, it still maintains the candidness and introspection of <strong>Chiyoda Ku’s</strong> earlier works. <strong>Chiyoda Ku</strong> are ravenous for the truth. The band went on hiatus after years of extensive touring around the UK and Europe, numerous festival appearances, van theft induced homelessness and a 3-boys-1-room living arrangement above a Bristol Dive bar. Living in different ends of the country, they were no longer talking, they had flat lined. Half way through the main world event, a faint pulse could be felt between them. After a back and forth the band decided to go for a 2 week writing holiday/lets make up session, this is where they wrote and fine tuned the album.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" seamless=\"\" data-src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1073571343/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><a href=\"https://chiyoda-ku.bandcamp.com/album/selecta-perspective-2\">Selecta Perspective by Chiyoda Ku</a></iframe></p>\n<p>To Celebrate the release of <em>‘Selecta Perspective’</em>, <strong>Chiyoda Ku</strong> will be playing a very special release show at <strong>Strange Brew</strong> in Bristol before embarking on a tour around the UK and Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>ORANGE SWAN</strong><br>\nPost/Progressive Rock / Doom / Atmospheric Drone / Ambient</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" data-srcset=\"https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-600x399.jpg 600w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-768x511.jpg 768w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN.jpg 1442w\" data-src=\"https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-600x399.jpg\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-81813 lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-81813\" src=\"https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-600x399.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-600x399.jpg 600w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN-768x511.jpg 768w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ORANGE-SWAN.jpg 1442w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></noscript></p>\n<p><strong>ORANGE SWAN</strong> is an instrumental 4 piece from Germany and Ireland.<br>\nBetween playful progressive rock, brutal stoner-doom riffing, atmospheric and psychedelic sounds, the German-Irish instrumental band tosses diverse perspectives on the genre (post) rock. As different as the band members are, their music also varies itself in the most different directions without losing its form. Numerous concerts with regional and international bands took them to desecrated churches, demolished industrial ruins and the finest clubs in Basel. They released several cassettes – including their debut <em>‘SEALED’</em> in 2015 – and took part in a variety of sampler contributions and furthermore cooperated with two Artzines.<br>\nThe band stood in front of the camera for <strong>the Cardinal Sessions</strong> in 2018 and played at <strong>the Open Source Festival</strong> in the same year. In late 2019 the release of their second album <em>‘PERSPECTIVES’</em> marked another milestone, just before the times of pandemic. Since it has been possible again, they have been playing live shows again. In 2022 they opened<strong> the Traumzeit Festival</strong>.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" seamless=\"\" data-src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3582446743/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><a href=\"https://orangeswan.bandcamp.com/album/p-e-r-s-p-e-c-t-i-v-e-s\">p e r s p e c t i v e s by ORANGE SWAN</a></iframe></p>\n<p>Mission statement: Keep your ears and eyes fluid – maintain perspectives!</p>"

Fay also composes for video games, with recent projects including music for the Divine Disco in Bloodhunt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sswanmeat.bandcamp.com/\">BANDCAMP</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/swanmeat\">SOUNDCLOUD</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/swan.meat/\">INSTA</a></p>\n<h2>Red Shades</h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Red shades\" width=\"338\" height=\"600\" data-srcset=\"https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/redsha-338x600.jpg 338w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/redsha-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/redsha-600x1067.jpg 600w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/redsha.jpg 720w\" data-src=\"https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/redsha-338x600.jpg\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-80756 lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-80756\" src=\"https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/redsha-338x600.jpg\" alt=\"Red shades\" width=\"338\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/redsha-338x600.jpg 338w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/redsha-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/redsha-600x1067.jpg 600w, https://occii.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/redsha.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" /></noscript></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Red Shades is Valdivia, K.

The background to this is music that can be fast and aggressive with biting commentary or slow, introspective and melodic – incorporating the best parts from early 00’s hardcore, crust, and post-hardcore.\nSince forming in 2017, FAIM has released a Self Titled 7″ on Convulse Records, a split 7″ with DISCOURAGE and LIFT, and their debut full-length, “Hollow Hope,” on Safe Inside Records. FAIM has done multiple US and European tours, sharing the stage with HAVE HEART, MODERN LIFE IS WAR, CEREMONY, and JUDGE.\nFAIM has just released their next full-length, “Your Life and Nothing Else”, on Safe Inside Records and will be touring the United States and Europe soon. It will be their last record.\nhttps://faim.bandcamp.com\nNØ MAN (Washington, DC / USA, hardcore, ex-Majority Rule)\nNØ MAN formed in 2017, shortly after Majority Rule reunited to play a benefit tour with long time friends PageNinetyNine. The band includes all three members (Matthew Michel, Kevin Lamiell and Pat Broderick) with the addition of Maha Shami on vocals. Maha’s voice may be familiar to some as she was a guest vocalist on MR’s “Packaged Poison” back in 2002.\nUpon returning from the MR reunion shows, the band swiftly wrote, recorded, and released “Devils Cast Long Shadows” in 2018 as an outlet to continue creating new music together. Since then, they’ve had the opportunity to tour with some incredible bands, including Portrayal of Guilt, Darkest Hour, The Hirs Collective and more. In their follow up record “Erase,” the band solidified their sound, blending mean chaotic punk that occasionally comes up for air with haunting, melodic breaks.\nhttps://nomanband.bandcamp.com\nOATS (Amsterdam, mathcore)\nThe Amsterdam punk act OATS have recently released their third single. OATS showcase their propensity to experiment and blend genres, from neo-soul to hardcore-punk, and pushing the boundaries of aggressive music by creating an explosion of tenderness and gut-churning fury that packs a punch. The song starts with a fast-paced bassline that’s swiftly accompanied by pounding drums, angular guitars and a distorted Alto Saxophone delivered by up-and-coming Jazz artist Miguel Valente (Nausyqa, YOPE). But around the 2 minute mark the band surprises us by delivering a velvety smooth Neo-Soul section, with a sax solo as the cherry on top, before unleashing the final act of the song.\nhttps://oatsband.com\n“When was the last time we heard something so chaotic in the Netherlands?” – Never Mind The Hype\nFAIM, NØ MAN, OATS\nBookings\nPayments can be made through iDeal / SEPA / PAYPAL / Credit Card\nTickets\nTicket price €10.00\nBooking fee €0.50Price€10,50\nSpaces\n1\n2\nRegistration Information\nTerms: I have read and agree to the Terms & Conditions\n*\nPayment and Confirmation\nI consent to my submitted data being collected and stored as outlined by the site",

Maha’s voice may be familiar to some as she was a guest vocalist on <strong>MR’s</strong> <em>“Packaged Poison”</em> back in 2002.<br>\nUpon returning from the <strong>MR</strong> reunion shows, the band swiftly wrote, recorded, and released <em>“Devils Cast Long Shadows”</em> in 2018 as an outlet to continue creating new music together. Since then, they’ve had the opportunity to tour with some incredible bands, including <strong>Portrayal of Guilt</strong>, <strong>Darkest Hour</strong>, <strong>The Hirs Collective</strong> and more. In their follow up record<em> “Erase,”</em> the band solidified their sound, blending mean chaotic punk that occasionally comes up for air with haunting, melodic breaks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nomanband.bandcamp.com\">https://nomanband.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>OATS</strong> (Amsterdam, mathcore)<br>\nThe Amsterdam punk act <strong>OATS</strong> have recently released their third single. <strong>OATS</strong> showcase their propensity to experiment and blend genres, from neo-soul to hardcore-punk, and pushing the boundaries of aggressive music by creating an explosion of tenderness and gut-churning fury that packs a punch. The song starts with a fast-paced bassline that’s swiftly accompanied by pounding drums, angular guitars and a distorted Alto Saxophone delivered by up-and-coming Jazz artist <strong>Miguel Valente</strong> (<strong>Nausyqa</strong>, <strong>YOPE</strong>). But around the 2 minute mark the band surprises us by delivering a velvety smooth Neo-Soul section, with a sax solo as the cherry on top, before unleashing the final act of the song.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://oatsband.com\">https://oatsband.com</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“When was the last time we heard something so chaotic in the Netherlands?” – <strong>Never Mind The Hype</strong></p>\n</blockquote>"
