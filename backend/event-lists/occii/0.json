This book ushers in a new era of freedom from reading and all its attendant bedfellows such as Enlightenment thinking and the mass alienation wrought by the phonetic alphabet. ‘Against the Written Word’ will be a tremendous best seller and simultaneously the last book that anyone will read.\nWith nineteen essays ripping, shredding, tearing apart all the bugaboos that haunt humanity nowadays, ‘Against the Written Word’ is a must-read for any aspiring radical or would-be gnostic who has a penchant for words, thought, clothes, intoxicants, music, art, expression, etc. The work is presented in a range of writing: essays, screenplays, lectures, sci-fi stories, and manifestos, with topics that include “the rise of incorporated man,” “tourism as the neoliberal mode of military occupation,” a workshop on songwriting for the purpose of suggestion and mind control, and many more.\nhttps://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/against-the-written-word-toward-a-universal-illiteracy/\nAlexandra Cabral, BOOK: Against the Written Word, ESCAPE-ISM, Ian Svenonius\nBookings\nPayments can be made through iDeal / SEPA / PAYPAL / Credit Card\nTickets\nTicket price €10.00\nBooking fee €0.50Price€10,50\nSpaces\n1\n2\nRegistration Information\nTerms: I have read and agree to the Terms & Conditions\n*\nPayment and Confirmation\nI consent to my submitted data being collected and stored as outlined by the site",

Starting as a fairly orthodox one-man endeavor, it was soon apparent that behind the ghastly mist of rabid riffs and ominous synths there was a far more complex and enigmatic beast dancing behind a veil of shadows.\nhttps://lampofmurmuur.bandcamp.com/\n– Invunche –\nDutch-Chilean band formed in 2012, combining elements of primitive punk, black metal and psychedelic rock. First emerging in the physical world in 2014 with its self titled debut, offering a unique take on minimalist Ildjarn worshipping sounds. In later releases the sound evolved into to its own musical entity, adding elements of krautrock, folk and psychedelia while retaining its energetic punk origins.\nRabid and relentless, Invunche seeks to pummel its listeners into psychedelic submission.\nhttps://invunche.bandcamp.com/\n– Faceless Entity –\nUltimately ritualistic in substance, untamed in praxis, the abyss takes form and onward emanates the wisdom of the dead. Contemplate life and death. Give in to the fear of the unknown and let that fear wreak mental havoc on your psyche. Breathe in slow; your imminent demise is just around the corner. Let us mourn for you.

Starting as a fairly orthodox one-man endeavor, it was soon apparent that behind the ghastly mist of rabid riffs and ominous synths there was a far more complex and enigmatic beast dancing behind a veil of shadows.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lampofmurmuur.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://lampofmurmuur.bandcamp.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>– Invunche –</strong><br>\nDutch-Chilean band formed in 2012, combining elements of primitive punk, black metal and psychedelic rock. First emerging in the physical world in 2014 with its self titled debut, offering a unique take on minimalist <strong>Ildjarn</strong> worshipping sounds. In later releases the sound evolved into to its own musical entity, adding elements of krautrock, folk and psychedelia while retaining its energetic punk origins.</p>\n<p>Rabid and relentless, <strong>Invunche</strong> seeks to pummel its listeners into psychedelic submission.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://invunche.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://invunche.bandcamp.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>– Faceless Entity –</strong><br>\nUltimately ritualistic in substance, untamed in praxis, the abyss takes form and onward emanates the wisdom of the dead. Contemplate life and death. Give in to the fear of the unknown and let that fear wreak mental havoc on your psyche. Breathe in slow; your imminent demise is just around the corner. Let us mourn for you.

Sok + SPACE SIREN (Aico, Gwendolien & Ineke + Cees & Bart of HOWRAH)\nL&S is an ambitious musical adventure, mixing rock and poetry with a symphony orchestra. The name of this band is short. Its musical history, however, long and divers. The new project of ANTHONY LAGUERRE (Nancy) and G.W. SOK (Amsterdam) arose out of the afterglow ashes of Filiamotsa (2007-2016), a band from the east of France that ceased to exist at the end of 2016. Their first full length album together was with Laguerre’s aforementioned group, which Sok had joined in 2014. In 2015 they released ‘Like It Is’, a harbinger of what was to come several years later.\nLaguerre (Myotis, Praag) and Sok (co-founder of The Ex and their singer till 2009, afterwards in bands such as Oiseaux-Tempête, Action Beat, ex-King Champion Sounds and lots more) embarked in 2020 on their challenging escapade, during which they desired to bring together rock, poetry and a symphony orchestra. A desire which made Sok take care of the texts (inspired by poets such as Ginsberg and Prévert), while Laguerre focused on the compositions (inspired too, by Gainsbourg for example). They brought in Eric Thomas on guitar and Jean-Michel Pires (Oiseaux-Tempête, Bruit Noir, Mendelson) on drums, and then joined forces with the Gradus Ad Musicam orchestra from Nancy.\nIn September 2022 the result of all this, their album ‘WHEN THE VOWELS FALL‘ was set free into the world.\n“Basically, the two bring alternative rock with a cinematic and poetic slant, which is less contrary than you may be used to from them. But make no mistake, the melancholy and the feelings they have incorporated are pretty intense (in a positive way, that is). The classical instruments certainly do not smooth things over, but only accentuate the emotions and manage to make the impact of the music land a little softer in a beautiful way. (…) The strong lyrics and music already make a deep impression, which is due to the eloquence of the vocals, half-songs and spoken word of G.W. Sock is taken to an even higher level. They operate at the crossroads where experimentation, avant-garde, rock, classical music and artistic beauty converge. (…) Both gentlemen really deliver an inimitable masterpiece here with their guests.” — JW Broek/De Subjectivisten, Sept. 26th, 2022\nDue to obvious practical reasons L&S performs live mainly as a four-piece. With the same impact, though, as when they would play together with an orchestra.\n“It remains to evoke the summit of this festival, one of those rare, exceptional moments, which rumor will soon tell you that you should have been there. As the storm rose on the Ponant, L&S blew a wind of poetry, and poured out, without splashing, the contained rage of a big sound without violence. The association of Lorraine bassist Anthony Laguerre and Dutch singer-writer G.W Sok, the friction of writing, thought and dark atmosphere, in tune with a world that laughs very little, produced a musical spark as we do not hear every spring. Neither rock nor jazz, this coherent universe, without frills, summons references such as Lou Reed, The Fall, the twilight Johnny Cash or the last embers of a dying Bashung. (…) a staggering project, which has bided its time during two years of pandemic.” — Le Télégramme, Oct. 21st 2022\nG.W. Sok – vocals\nAnthony Laguerre – guitar, bass, orchestra-samples\nJean-Michel Pires – drums\nEric Thomas – guitar\nL&S // CAN’T BREATHE // WHEN THE VOWELS FALL\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/A8l5htsyeLI\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img\nalt=\"L&amp;amp;S // CAN&rsquo;T BREATHE // WHEN THE VOWELS FALL\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" data-src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8l5htsyeLI/0.jpg\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" /><noscript><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8l5htsyeLI/0.jpg\" alt=\"L&amp;amp;S // CAN&rsquo;T BREATHE // WHEN THE VOWELS FALL\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" />Watch this video on YouTube\nSPACE SIREN\nYes, we know it is and isn’t, of course. But Bart and Cees from Howrah go some way to fill guitarist Corno Zwetsloot’s shoes. Expect some absolute golden moments from one of the greatest Dutch independent rock bands in the last 20 years and one of the true kickstarters of what is now called the Dutch underground. Those who know, know.\nLayered guitars and a sweet succulent voice pull you in and spit you out – gently. Indie band Space Siren is moody without being too heavy, and catchy without being too poppy. Their songs sound like they know where they’re going, but they’ll never let you in on the secret. They have that forward drive every band should have: the sound of needing to make music, not just wanting to.\n<a href=\"https://spacesiren.bandcamp.com/album/dgdabe\">DGDABE by Space Siren</a>\nhttps://www.instagram.com/_space_siren_/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/spacesiren\nAnthony Laguerre, G.W.

They operate at the crossroads where experimentation, avant-garde, rock, classical music and artistic beauty converge. (…) Both gentlemen really deliver an inimitable masterpiece here with their guests.” — <strong>JW Broek/De Subjectivisten</strong>, Sept. 26th, 2022</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Due to obvious practical reasons <strong>L&amp;S</strong> performs live mainly as a four-piece. With the same impact, though, as when they would play together with an orchestra.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It remains to evoke the summit of this festival, one of those rare, exceptional moments, which rumor will soon tell you that you should have been there. As the storm rose on the Ponant, L&amp;S blew a wind of poetry, and poured out, without splashing, the contained rage of a big sound without violence. The association of Lorraine bassist Anthony Laguerre and Dutch singer-writer G.W Sok, the friction of writing, thought and dark atmosphere, in tune with a world that laughs very little, produced a musical spark as we do not hear every spring. Neither rock nor jazz, this coherent universe, without frills, summons references such as Lou Reed, The Fall, the twilight Johnny Cash or the last embers of a dying Bashung. (…) a staggering project, which has bided its time during two years of pandemic.” — <strong>Le Télégramme</strong>, Oct. 21st 2022</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://gwsok.nl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">G.W.

But <strong>Bart</strong> and <strong>Cees</strong> from <strong>Howrah</strong> go some way to fill guitarist <strong>Corno Zwetsloot</strong>’s shoes. Expect some absolute golden moments from one of the greatest Dutch independent rock bands in the last 20 years and one of the true kickstarters of what is now called the Dutch underground. Those who know, know.<br>\nLayered guitars and a sweet succulent voice pull you in and spit you out – gently. Indie band <strong>Space Siren</strong> is moody without being too heavy, and catchy without being too poppy. Their songs sound like they know where they’re going, but they’ll never let you in on the secret. They have that forward drive every band should have: the sound of needing to make music, not just wanting to.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" seamless=\"\" data-src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2774102629/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><a href=\"https://spacesiren.bandcamp.com/album/dgdabe\">DGDABE by Space Siren</a></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_space_siren_/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/_space_siren_/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/spacesiren\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/spacesiren</a></p>"

Without leaving the drama origins behind, the band plays an abrasive, evocative mix of noise rock, post-punk, and blues. To some they are one of the most challenging bands to emerge live right now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://auralconduct.bandcamp.com/album/washing-hands\">https://auralconduct.bandcamp.com/album/washing-hands</a></p>\n<p>Poster photo: Jose Estevao de Conceicao</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
