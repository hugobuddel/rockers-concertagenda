<p>Beware! Accursed souls of the city of the damned. On the eve of the 17th of June, the putrid canals of Amsterdam will be smelling even worse as a trio of sin-fueled bands will leave their mark on the OCCII. Of the 3 groups marking the corners of the unholy trinity, the mighty Mystifier graces its top.</p>
<p><strong>MYSTIFIER</strong></p>
<p>Legendary bringers of warfare and blackness, the Brazilian beasts of Mystifier will bring destruction upon Amsterdam for the very first time. This pivotal show is part of their black dynasty tour. From 1989 onwards, they have been unleashing their depraved spectral black metal upon this doomed planet. Their influence runs deep into the roots of all unholy music, shiver in terror as you witness their black magic.</p>
<p><strong>RATTENBURCHT</strong></p>
<p>Rattus Norvegicus, Amsterdam’s most pesky disease ridden swarm, has transmuted into the vampyric group known as Rattenburcht. Archaic beats, primitive riffs and wretched screeches amalgamate into black punk blasphemy.</p>
<p><strong>WITCHFUKKER</strong></p>
<p>From the lowest pits of the Netherlands hail Witchfukker, a death-obsessed duo conjuring speedy deathrash. Absolute sadistik old-school devotion, guaranteed face melting fukked up madness.</p>
