Anni Nöps – hybrid</strong></p>
<p>Janushoved (DK) has continued to be a prescient forerunner of the ambient and noise scene since 2014, its roots firmly planted in the Copenhagen DIY scene. It’s sensuous music pleases aesthetically on multiple levels – making beauty common-good. Janushoveds label head (known musically as) Internazionale graced zenevloed with a striking performance in 2017, which was a long-cherished wish. Now, we are over the moon to be able to host Tettix Hexer, Ferox Maw, Hasfeldt, and Internazionale celebrating the label’s 8-year anniversary. Supporting this show is Anni Nöps, well-versed in haunting melodies, organic textures, and glistening kicks.</p>
<p>5 YRS ZENEVLOED<br>
Zenevloed has grown over the past years to be an international, transdisciplinary<br>
collective. We have continued to dedicate ourselves to presenting experimental music and art globally, in fitting contexts, reaching out to defining presences in the scene – based on qualitative output rather than amounts of clicks. Adhering to collaborative DIY/DIT ethics, networks have blossomed into friendships. In our 5 year anniversary we hone these connections by inviting close collaborators to exchange during concerts, radio shows, and events this year. And, as always, we will not get chased into the death drive of ‘performing’ in the scene.</p>
<p>Ambient / Noise / Experimental</p>
<p>Internazionale<br>
Internazionale is a framework in which stories are told. An introspective realm in which Mikkel Dunkerley examines themes that seem to shift as tectonic plates beneath the visible structures, and aesthetic languages of each project. Presenting a variety of ambient soundscapes, Internazionale creates spaces in which a visionary ascension becomes possible, to the listener that seeks to engage with the music through emotional presence and conceptual curiosity. Mikkel is the founder of Janushoved, in which each release is a new contributive jigsaw puzzle in his growing, world-building narrative. Janushoved is heavily affiliated with the experimental hemisphere surrounding Mayhem in Copenhagen’s underground that, for years, has built a reputation of fragments of noise and unsolved viscerality.</p>
<p>Tettix Hexer<br>
Tettix Hexer is a well-known face on the Danish underground scenes of Odense and Copenhagen, known for intensely hard-hitting live shows, euphoric and full of longing. Visionary production explores the idea of future-distant, empathic AI memories through anthropocene mythology. With digital gardening, vocaloid phonettix and sonic alchemy, Tettix Hexer is blooming with odd variations of the present.</p>
<p>Ferox Maw<br>
Hailing from the tropical east coast of Australia Ferox Maw aka Finnian Cooney has been passionately creating textures and movement across a very wide field of genres – bending the known ground between tonal forms and industrial hues. With releases under Melbourne based label Steeplejack and Copenhagen based labels Janushoved and Amniote Edtions they have released music which explore the possibilities of auditory emotion and impression under the banners of deep sound design and subsonic weight. With their latest release on French based label Gautama they have puts forth colours of the subconscious euphoria and disintegration with a clear intention to reach for the listeners own perceived inspiration.<br>
Having recently finished their masters in live electronics at the conservatorium van Amsterdam Ferox is incredibly excited to be performing out in the same city with such a great collective of friends.</p>
<p>Hasfeldt<br>
Martin Jon Hasfeldt is a Copenhagen-based interdisciplinary artist, who works in domains such as performance, and visual and auditory art.<br>
For this evening he will present works primarily focusing on his musical output.<br>
His artistic diversity is evident in his varied musical expression, producing from club-like music as well as ambient and experiential soundscapes. Realtime synthesized samples, orienting the listener in distorted everyday spaces and moods.</p>
<p>Anni Nöps<br>
Anni Nöps (hybrid live/DJ set) is a sound artist, electronic composer and DJ based in the Netherlands. Her sonic palette is bold and explorative, comprising hard hitting percussions, floating melodies and tactile noise. She has performed and presented her sonic works at arebyte gallery (London), FIBER Festival (Amsterdam), Sonic Acts Festival (Amsterdam), Tetem Kunstruimte (Enschede) &amp; Rewire Festival (the Hague) and has recently collaborated with contemporary choreographers at ICK/Veem Amsterdam and Stuttgart Ballet.<br>
