Will be an evening of primitive and yet futuristic drones, soaked in the sludge of nightmarish times. Our friends OvO, italian noise/sludge/hellish duo, came out with a new album “Ignoto” in September 2022 and they will be hitting the road with crushing Hardcore-Punk &amp; Doom trio Body Void from the USA, who just released their latest EP “Burn The Homes Of Those Who Seek To Control Our Bodies” (2022) and will release a new album before the tour in 2023.</div>

<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xdj266r">OvO has been at the center of the worldwide Post-Rock, Industrial-Sludge and Avant-Doom scenes for two decades.<br>
Genre-expansive, OvO brings blackened elements to the forefront of a noisy canvas with sinister drone underpinnings.<br>
Like the soundtrack to your deepest fears, Ignoto is an album both profound and unsettling.</div>

Heart-wrenching riffs &amp; drones against the ecological collapse, a failing society, an unjust and broken system</span></div>

The band takes a non-traditional approach to doom metal by merging it with noise, dark jazz and improv – while keeping it instrumental.<br>
Though vocals are absent, through the use of speech samples the band explores the dark and manipulative side of the human mind.</span></div>
