<p>enmossed meets zenevloed</p>

<p>Line up:</p>
<p>Glyn Maier – live</p>
<p>Danny Wolfers – live</p>
<p>Patrick Gallaghar – live</p>

<p>“The delicacy extended by enmossed to all their endeavours, outputs, and connections speaks of an explicit non-extractive stance to life, music, friendship, the commons and the DIY-cultures that run through these informal networks. enmossed has introduced the scene to a breadth of inspiring musicians, offering some of their most thought-provoking pieces – always not-for-profit, where proceeds go to great causes such as the Women’s Law Project, Afrorack, and the Carolina Abortion Fund. We are humbled to be able to welcome representatives of enmossed in July.”</p>
<p>5 YRS ZENEVLOED</p>
<p>Zenevloed has grown over the past years to be an international, transdisciplinary<br>
collective. We have continued to dedicate ourselves to presenting experimental music and art globally, in fitting contexts, reaching out to defining presences in the scene – based on qualitative output rather than amounts of clicks. Adhering to collaborative DIY/DIT ethics, networks have blossomed into friendships. In our 5 year anniversary we hone these connections by inviting close collaborators to exchange during concerts, radio shows, and events this year. And, as always, we will not get chased into the death drive of ‘performing’ in the scene.</p>
<p>Noise / Industrial / Ambient / Rhythmic</p>
<p><strong>Glyn Maier (US)</strong><br>
is a sound artist and field recordist living in Pisgah Forest, North Carolina, USA.</p>
<p>Non-city outdoor spaces are essential to Maier’s practice. With a formal education in physics and music composition, Maier’s preoccupations with natural objects, landscapes, and their social histories guide his recordings, which are then integrated into ambient electronic works utilising organic rhythms and complex timbres. Maier’s abstract synthesis work is deeply informed by sound design, but his larger focus is on the agency of both machine and environment.</p>
<p>Another facet of Maier’s sonic practice is enmossed, the label he founded in 2017. Dedicated to contemporary sound, all profits are donated to positive causes of the artist’s choice, and materials for the tapes and records are hand-constructed out of recycled materials.</p>
<p><strong>Patrick Gallagher (US)</strong><br>
is a sound artist currently based in Philadelphia, USA. With an education in mathematics, Gallagher employs generative/algorithmic processes, guided improvisation, and intuitive sound collage in an effort to weave evocative and evolving sonic narratives. Exploring the various developments of 20th century composition and contemporary computer music, he seeks to fuse that technicality with the cathartic and rapturous nature of the DIY noise underground. Previous works employed a wide range of sound sources – synthesisers, field recordings, tabletop guitar, etc. – however, Gallagher currently focuses almost entirely on digital synthesis, particularly additive and granular techniques.</p>
<p>Gallagher has released albums on cassette and vinyl through ENxPL (enmossed x Psychic Liberation), Hot Releases, Refulgent Sepulchre, Tone Log, and other independent labels.</p>
<p><strong>BAGLOVER (CAN/NL)</strong><br>
Baglover performs live noise, power electronics and industrial, using analog synths, field recordings, contact mics, with vocals sung in Dutch, French, German and English. They collaborated with Legowelt under the moniker Star Shepherd resulting in a tape on Nightwind Records described as ‘sing-a-long existentialist exotica to power-noise ambient to woolly hypnotic saturated melodies, a new dawn in lo-fi counter culture synthesis.’</p>
<div class="cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle"><strong>Alchemulator aka Danny Wolfers (NL)</strong></div>
<div class="cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle">ALCHEMULATOR is a sideproject of Danny Wolfers focusing on RPG fantasy influenced ‘adventure’ music with some noise, drone and fieldrecording stuff throw in for good measure.</div>
<div class="cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle">Alchemulator’s first album “LARPING AT FAIRSNAKE MARKET” was released on Baglover’s HUNGER! label in 2021. The album was made on the infamous Yamaha PSS480 keyboard. The history of the Yamaha PSS FM range keyboards of the late 1980’s is fascinating and niche: a cheap consumer semi-toy home keyboard with spartan synthesizer functions based around a specially designed FM sound chip.</div>
<div class="cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle">The chip, which is a low cost and cut down version of FM synthesis found in the mighty Yamaha DX7 – the digital synthesizer that defined pop music in the 1980’ – brings forth a mere sketch of its distant DX7 cousin. Feeble attempts to emulate the mighty DX7’s electric piano or staccato bass sounds on one of these keyboards are futile. Instead, a plethora of unique lo-fi tones resound. Unexpected artifacts are plentiful: cracks and hisses are present, giving the sounds a strange otherworldly and organic undercurrent, which are to be heard on the album.</div>
<div class="cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle">This chip found its way in a number of 1990’s computer sound cards, scoring the music of many RPG adventure game worlds, exposing an entire generation of geeks and cyberpunks to its digital dusty yet crystalline warm spectrum of sounds. The instant association with fantasy adventures makes it ideal for old school fantasy synth composing. Escape this savage life and enter Alchemulator’s world of ADVENTURE!!!</div>
