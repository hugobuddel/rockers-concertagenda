<p>Ronald Langestraat’s cosmic jazz played in the hotel lobby at the end of the universe has been taking shape over the years, just like the astral dust of an asteroid belt. In this latest formation, the trio of Ronald on keys and vocals, Nicolini on drums and Goya on bass deliver Ronald’s warp-factor blend of samba, lounge, funk and jazz with a heavy dose of Oosterpark soul.</p>
<p>Nicolini brings his deconstructed drum tracks and mutated dancehall to the stage, packed full with bouncy bubble-wrapped bass, dreamy sax loops, and sound system experiments for the freeform skank rebels.</p>
