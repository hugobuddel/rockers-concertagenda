<p>In cooperation with the boys from <strong>Doomstar Bookings</strong> and the <strong>Dynamo Metal</strong> crew, the masters of gore grind <strong>Rompeprop</strong> present the 9th edition of their <strong>Grindhoven Festival in Dynamo</strong>. The band is indeed dead, but that does not mean that their legacy should also be in a coffin, right? <strong>R.I.P Rompeprop, long live Grindhoven!</strong></p>
<p>Expect a lot of great, gory and disgusting bands and of course DJ Steven Smegma, completed by various bizarre acts, parasols, some good ol’ schlagers and ’smartlappen’, and of course the hosts themselves, the extremely friendly Rompeprop guys!</p>
<h5><strong>WOLFBRIGADE</strong></h5>
<p>Replacing our previously announced headliner Entombed AD was not easy, especially due to the reason of cancellation, RIP LG, this edition will be in your honour! We do consider ourselves extremely lucky to announce a band from the same country that had been on our wishlist for quite some time, the mighty hardcore punk rockers of Wolfbrigade! Perfect band to end with, raise your firsts and/or beers and get in that circle pit to run with the hunted!<br>

<h5>RECTAL SMEGMA</h5>
<p>Rectal Smegma was initially formed in 2003 by four guys from the west of The Netherlands, who set out to create brutal gore grind with lots of groove, blastbeats and a humoristic party vibe all over. The music has undergone some changes in the meantime as well, evolving from Neanderthal porn gore grind to fast aggressive blasting goregrind with loads of groovy death metal and even some hints of punk. This is the first band ever to make a 2nd appearance at Grindhoven<br>

<h5>FEASTEM</h5>
<p>Feastem was formed in the small port town of Raahe, on the northwestern coast of Finland in 2005 with one intent in mind: to play the fastest, most pissed off grindcore imaginable. “From the vein and hernia exploding level of sheer charismatic rage in the vocals, the inhumanly metronomic and punishing blasting and d-beats, and all the hyper-speed Discharge-cum-Motörhead punk riffing drenched in Scando-fuzz you could wish for, they are the complete package. …Feastem are one of the kings of grindcore the world right now.<br>
