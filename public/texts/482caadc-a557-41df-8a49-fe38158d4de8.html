<p>“a remarkable listen…There’s an unnerving magic and beauty that plays throughout their harsh noise, like a dense mist lifting off a still river….Through glowing stasis and solemn ceremony, <strong>Divide and Dissolve’s</strong> sonics of despair and destruction have been crafted into a remarkably life-affirming experience, and it’s never been more needed.” – ★★★★ <strong>NME</strong></p>

<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s">“<strong>Divide and Dissolve</strong> invest their dense and driven music with a unique perspective. These days, addressing race and gender in doom metal is considered extreme in itself; with <em>Gas Lit</em> the duo demonstrates that extremity is not just found through deftly executed blastbeats and downtuned riffs, but within the decision to create music that defies categorisation.” – <strong>The Wire</strong></div>

<p><strong>DIVIDE AND DISSOLVE</strong> Australia</p>
<p>From the early protest songs that came from the violent occupation of Turtle Island (so-called United States), through punk music’s fight against the system, art has always been at the forefront of societal change. Whether that be through pointed attacks or something more existential – sung quietly or performed as loud as can be – music continues to be a spring-board for collective resistance.</p>
<p>Even so, few bands use their voice and platform quite as powerfully as <strong>Divide and Dissolve</strong>. Mirroring the brash, bone-crushing potency of their dynamic Drone music, the formidable <strong>Divide And Dissolve</strong> carry their fight and ancestors fight forward each and every day, using the power of their performances to draw attention to the ongoing battle against systemic oppression.</p>
<p><em>“We would like to observe a radical shift in the current paradigm of complacency in regards to oppressive power dynamics, genocide, racism, white supremacy, and colonization,”</em> the band have previously said. <em>“To give weight and validation to voices that are traditionally misrepresented and criminalized before given a chance to speak.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Divide and Dissolve’s</strong> new and fourth album<em> Systemic</em> examines the systems that intrinsically bind us and calls for a system that facilitates life for everyone. It’s a message that fits with the band’s core intention: to make music that honours their ancestors and Indigenous land, to oppose white supremacy, and to work towards a future of Black and Indigenous liberation.</p>
<p>Saxophonist and guitarist <strong>Takiaya Reed</strong> comments,<em> “This music is an acknowledgement of the dispossession that occurs due to colonial violence,”</em> She continues, “<em>The goal of the colonial project is to separate Indigenous people from their culture, their life force, their community and their traditions. The album is in direct opposition to this.”</em></p>
<p>Like its predecessor <em>Gas Lit</em>, <em>Systemic</em> was produced by <strong>Ruban Neilson</strong> of <strong>Unknown Mortal Orchestra</strong> and arrives on all formats through <strong>Invada</strong> on 30th June 2023 and is preceded by the lead single/video<em> “Blood Quantum”</em> which calls into question the violent process of verification of Identity.</p>
<p><strong>Divide and Dissolve</strong> are focused on Indigenous Sovereignty. <strong>Takiaya</strong> is Black and Cherokee, and <strong>Sylvie</strong> is Maori. As a duo they released two full length albums, <em>Basic</em> (2017) and <em>Abomination</em> (2018) through <strong>DERO Arcade</strong> before signing with <strong>Invada</strong> to release their widely acclaimed third album <em>Gas Lit</em> in 2021, which was hailed <strong>Mary Anne Hobbs’</strong> Album of the Year.</p>
<p>A<em> Gas Lit</em> remix EP was released in 2021, including reworking of <strong>Divide and Dissolve’s</strong> music by <strong>Moor Mother</strong>, <strong>Chelsea Wolfe</strong> and <strong>Bearcat</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Divide and Dissolve</strong> toured throughout North America and Europe in 2022 supporting <strong>Low</strong> and performing headline dates and festival appearances and have live shows and festival appearances planned in support of <em>Systemic</em>, including appearances at <strong>Supersonic Festival</strong> and<strong> End of the Road</strong>. At this time, due to personal reasons, <strong>Sylvie</strong> will be stepping back from her duties performing live with the band.</p>
