<p>Sharp Teeth Festival is a recurring festival that will focus on one sub-genre within the Metal each edition. Every edition will feature a number of international acts combined by the strongest homegrown talent.<br>
The first edition is called ‘The Black Metal Mass I’ and focuses entirely on the Black Metal scene. We have worked with heart and soul on a spectacular bill for a very reasonable price, we do our utmost to make the festival accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
