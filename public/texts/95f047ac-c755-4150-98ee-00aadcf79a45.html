<p>"Due to the uncertainty surrounding touring across Europe right now, we have made the difficult decision to limit our touring this spring to the UK and cancel our mainland European dates in April and May.&nbsp; While we’re beyond disappointed about the spring dates, we have rescheduled Biarritz for August 28th and Paris for August 31st, tickets for those April shows will be honored for August, refunds for all cancelled spring dates are available at point of purchase.</p>
<p>We hope you can understand that we wish it didn't have to come to this. We want nothing more than to play for all of you in Europe and it pains us to once again have to change our plans due to forces that are out of our control. While the music has always been the primary focus and motivation for the members of METZ, capacity restrictions and unpredictable lockdowns across parts of Europe have made it near impossible to tour (hire crew, transport, and book lodgings) with any acceptable level of confidence that our shows won't be canceled at short notice. We would like to thank our excellent promoters and all the people who had already bought tickets and were looking forward to the shows. We hope to see all of you soon. For those of you in the UK and cities we’ll play in August - let’s make these the most memorable METZ shows yet!</p>
<p>Love, METZ"</p>
