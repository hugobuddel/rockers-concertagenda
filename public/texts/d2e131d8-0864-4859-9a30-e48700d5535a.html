<p>30 YRS SCREEMING AT A WALL ~ OCCii [1992-2022] DAY ii:</p>
<p>&nbsp; KOU (FR) + DJ’s Cheb Gero (FR, Akuphone) &amp; Papelón Kifesh (Rebel Up!) </p>
<p>band name : KOU<br>
members : Apolline Schöser &amp; Thomas Coquelet<br>
origins : Lille (France)</p>
<p>First, KOU slices and glues the scraps of the life of sounds on a blank page of an Audacity project. Subsequently evolving like a blob in compositions and even songs.<br>
Since last year Apolline and Thomas travel the world to pick up there 24 harmoniums from the Kasriel brand as well as the red bricks from the north of France.<br>
Thus, you will hear the slats and fans of their metal bodies singing and smiling combining with other incongruous instruments and voices.</p>
