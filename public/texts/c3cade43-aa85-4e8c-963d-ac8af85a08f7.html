<div><strong>Deez Nuts</strong></div>
<div>
<p>Former I Killed the Prom Queen drummer JJ Peters founded Deez Nuts in Melbourne, Australia, in 2007, taking the band’s name from a Dr. Dre song. Equally influenced by hardcore punk and hip-hop, the group’s lyrics focused on partying as well as hustling, and the group’s 2008 debut album, Stay True, appropriately contained a cover of Beastie Boys‘ “Fight for Your Right.”</p>
