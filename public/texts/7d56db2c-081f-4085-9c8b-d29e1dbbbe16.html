<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s">GNOD! How can a band be both a bitter meditation on life’s struggles and injustices and a full-on serotonin fueled celebration of living another day simultaneously? We are thrilled to invite GNOD back to the OCCII. Their psychedelia-rooted noise rock has been close to us for more than a decade, and after seeing 20-odd shows, we can guarantee: you don’t want to miss out.</div>

<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s">HARRGA (Avon Terror Corps). Furious electronics with fiery vocals. Though not explicitly political, their work confronts cruel power imbalances in the western world. Spitting anger at systems beating people down the ladder to maintain their position in meaningless hierarchies.</div>
