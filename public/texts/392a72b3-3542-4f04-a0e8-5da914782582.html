<h1>Yugofuturism presents!</h1>
<p>Co-hosting an OCCII Amsterdam show for the brilliant post punk band <strong>Atol Atol Atol</strong> from Wroclaw/Poland, with familiar faces from among others <strong>Kurws</strong> &amp; <strong>Przepych</strong>, supported by <strong>Library Card</strong> from Rotterdam.</p>
<p><strong><br>
ATOL ATOL ATOL</strong><br>
Island post-punk from the south of Poland. The tour includes: unlimited cellar snorkeling, coffee on Enewetak and Bikini atolls, free time in the central depression. The cruise crew includes: <strong>Łukasz Plata</strong> (<strong>Ukryte Zalety Systemu</strong>, <strong>Przepych</strong>), <strong>Artur Soszynski</strong> (<strong>Ukryte Zalety Systemu</strong>) and <strong>Hubert Kostkiewicz</strong> (<strong>Kurws</strong>), powered by vocalist <strong>Agata Horwat</strong>. The whole is tied together with a dub brace by master of the console <strong>Szymon Szwarc</strong> (<strong>Jesień</strong>, <strong>Rozwód</strong>). <em>„Koniec sosu tysiąca wysp”</em> (The End of the Thousand Island Sauce) is an angular, overstimulated, rhythmically organized yet freedom-hungry punkoid in the vein of no wave or <strong>Minutemen</strong>, with a face that resembles absolutely no one.<br>

<p><strong>LIBRARY CARD</strong><br>
In the summer of 2021, <strong>Library Card</strong> originated from the close-knit Rotterdam music scene. While writing their first few songs to a drum machine, <strong>Lot van Teylingen</strong>, <strong>Mitchell Quitz</strong> and <strong>Kat Kalkman</strong> found common ground within their love for expressive and thoughtful music. Soon after, the band recruited <strong>Emre Karayalçin</strong> whose unorthodox and articulate rhythms completed <strong>Library Card</strong>’s sound.<br>
With their first release <em>‘Mirror Factory’,</em> the band clearly illustrated its ability to create captivating universes which perfectly encapsulate <strong>Van Teylingen</strong>‘s impactful and emotional storytelling. On the 19th of October the band will release the live-session of their hostile and menacing song <em>‘Residual Heat’</em>. The session, shot in an empty office building, shows the band engulfing every nook and cranny with their sonic intensity.<br>
