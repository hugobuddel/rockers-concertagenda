    <p>We're pleased to welcome salute to Amsterdam for a headlining night at Parallel alongside Vuur and Bastienne. The Vienna-born, Manchester-based DJ and producer has a deep fascination with British dance music. salute's earlier work leaned toward softer melodies, but their recent music is tailor-made for ecstatic dance floors. Tracks like 'Joy' and 'Wait For It,' and their recent Disclosure remix 'Looking For Love,' pulse with nocturnal energy, featuring upbeat dance beats and hypnotic samples, reflecting influences from Daft Punk and the iconic Roul√© Records sound.</p>
<p>Their music received acclaim from renowned figures like Four Tet, DJ Seinfeld, Floating Points, and Mall Grab. salute evolved into a cult sensation and standout DJ performer, gracing packed crowds at The Warehouse Project and ADE, and a memorable Boiler Room Vienna show, harkening back to their early production days. Now signed to their childhood dream label, Ninja Tune, and working on their debut album, the future looks bright for Salute.</p>
