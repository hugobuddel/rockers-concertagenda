<p>30 YRS SCREEMING AT A WALL ~ OCCii [1992-2022] DAY I: PORTRON PORTRON LOPEZ (FR) + OlOlOlOP + Arakawa Atushi (JP) + YODEL QUEEN (AMS)</p>
<p>PORTRON PORTRON LOPEZ (France)<br>
Springboard Rock</p>
<p>Strange in a positive way, fantastic, pretty, pleasant : curious shapes and distorted forms – something unique that simultaneously invokes in an audience a feeling of privileged status as well as sympathetic blush. It’s a powerful magnet grabbing everybody’s attention.<br>
Incisive chords, surreal blues, beautiful people. SMILES. Notes trying to strike a balance between art-and-precision conceptual melodies away from traditional structures.</p>
<p>///</p>
<p>Portron Portron Lopez was created in 2011. Their music could be described as springboard rock.</p>
<p>What they do have is the audacity of youth and solid musical talent that stirs up a crowd. People aren’t headbanging, instead, Portron Portron Lopez’s music prompts the horizontal moves of shaking hips. What else can happen with the frenzied tempo of afrobeat topped with some insane rock and wild drumming?</p>
<p>Two of the three musicians are guitarists driving the music like two race cars up a mountain road trying to overtake one another, even on bends. Their records sounds like every speed possible on a low-visibility drive along a cliffside. Overall, it is an invitation to dance and laugh.</p>
<p>“Ice Cream Soufi” is the name of their fourth album; the titles of each track sum up the offbeat nature of this whole thing. Between ‘Comment Vas-Tu Rossignol’ and ‘Tayau’ lies a whole world of choppy tambourines and fret buzz galore born out of the trio’s symbiosis. They only take things seriously with their music as a whole. Their sound is solid but not<br>
rigid, exceptional but not boastful and their prowess with their instruments shines in every piece. The guitar sounds can paint the picture of a cutter-shredded masterpiece just as skillfully as the serene landscape of sunset.</p>
