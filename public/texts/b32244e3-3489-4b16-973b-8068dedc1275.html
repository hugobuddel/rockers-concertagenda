<p>Februari 25th–UNLOCKING THE STELLAR CRYPT V</p>
<p>SILVER KNIFE</p>
<p>This relatively new entity has been gaining momentum in the live circuit ever since their devastating debut show at Roadburn2022. This comes as no surprise, since this international outfit featuring members of Laster, Wolvennest and Hypothermia bring an exquisite blend of soul gripping black metal and atmospheric spaciousness that envelops any venue in absolute pitch-black melancholic darkness.</p>

<p>AINSOPH</p>
<p>The gnostic all-encompassing nothing, the highest level of the cosmic void. Ainsoph present a blend of psychedelic post-punk with flourishes drawn from black metal and even some heavy 70’s rock. The clear voice of I.V.enlightens a heavy blend of swirling guitarsand highly creative drum patterns. With a pandemic-era show they are no stranger to dB’s but now they are back in full force. With a post-punk/black metal style cover of Funkadelic on their last album “Ω –V”, enough is said.</p>

<p>LIJKSCHOUWER</p>
<p>Lijkschouwer hail from the ever creative and almost hyperactive punk/sludge scene in the harbor city of Rotterdam. With members of Ache in their lineup who played a devasting show at dB’s last September with citymates Vulva, they are no strangers to our city’s underground scene. However, Lijkschouwer brings us an even deadlier combo of black-sludge-death-doom metal that is sure to shake the very foundations of our collective psyche. Dark, oppressive and gnarly, be sure to catch this band and their brand new record “Lamentations of Cosmic Absurdity”live on the 25th.</p>
