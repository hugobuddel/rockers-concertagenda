<p><strong>SAVAGEHEADS</strong></p>
<p>Boston, USA, Hardcore/Punk<br>
..”raging <strong>UK82</strong>-in-‘22 pogo joy and the perfect soundtrack for cheap cider and solvent abuse. Snotty, amphetamine-rapid riffs, sneered vocals sticking two fingers up to every establishment of which you can think, and pounding drums that feel like the heartbeat of an anxiety attack. People will compare this to yer <strong>ABRASIVE WHEELS</strong>, yer <strong>SKEPTIX</strong>, yer <strong>PARTISANS</strong>, etc.,” –<a href="https://www.maximumrocknroll.com/band/savageheads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://www.maximumrocknroll.com/band/savageheads/</a></p>
