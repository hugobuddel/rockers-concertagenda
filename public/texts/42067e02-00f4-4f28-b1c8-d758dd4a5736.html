<p>This Dutch poster which I got from Marcel Stol is about the presentation for the Netherlands of the new book, published by the Hope Collective in Ireland.<br>
It is called Punks Listen. Over 200 people from the punk environment wrote in it what their favourite record, or most influential record, is, and why.<br>
From 20th century veterans like Henry Rollins, ex-Black Flag from the USA, to newest wave punks like Emma Paulissen from the Netherlands. People from British bands from Crass to Generation X. From Ireland, France … etc. etc.<br>
All proceeds will be used for Red Cross work for victims of the war in Ukraine.<br>
The presentation will be on Friday 7 October in OCCII, Amstelveenseweg 134 in Amsterdam. Door open at 8pm.<br>
First, Marcel Stol of the band Neuroot, Herman de Tollenaere of Cheap ‘n’ Nasty, Emma Paulissen of Daddy, and Andries van den Broek of Bunch of Bastards will say what record they chose, and why.<br>
Then, three bands will play: Daddy of Emma, Neuroot of Marcel, and Bunch of Bastards of Andries.</p>
