<h1>Breaking Records / World’s Appreciated Kitsch present: FAIM + NØ MAN + OATS</h1>
<p><strong>FAIM</strong> (Denver, USA, political hardcore – last tour ever)<br>
For Denver’s <strong>FAIM</strong>, hardcore is not just music – it’s the jumping-off point for critique, growth, and catharsis. The background to this is music that can be fast and aggressive with biting commentary or slow, introspective and melodic – incorporating the best parts from early 00’s hardcore, crust, and post-hardcore.<br>
Since forming in 2017, <strong>FAIM</strong> has released a Self Titled 7″ on <strong>Convulse Records</strong>, a split 7″ with <strong>DISCOURAGE</strong> and <strong>LIFT</strong>, and their debut full-length, “Hollow Hope,” on Safe Inside Records. FAIM has done multiple US and European tours, sharing the stage with <strong>HAVE HEART</strong>, <strong>MODERN LIFE IS WAR</strong>, <strong>CEREMONY</strong>, and <strong>JUDGE</strong>.<br>
<strong>FAIM</strong> has just released their next full-length, <em>“Your Life and Nothing Else”,</em> on <strong>Safe Inside Records</strong> and will be touring the United States and Europe soon. It will be their last record.<br>

<p><strong>NØ MAN</strong> (Washington, DC / USA, hardcore, ex-Majority Rule)<br>
<strong>NØ MAN</strong> formed in 2017, shortly after <strong>Majority Rule</strong> reunited to play a benefit tour with long time friends <strong>PageNinetyNine</strong>. The band includes all three members (<strong>Matthew Michel</strong>, <strong>Kevin Lamiell</strong> and <strong>Pat Broderick</strong>) with the addition of <strong>Maha Shami</strong> on vocals. Maha’s voice may be familiar to some as she was a guest vocalist on <strong>MR’s</strong> <em>“Packaged Poison”</em> back in 2002.<br>
Upon returning from the <strong>MR</strong> reunion shows, the band swiftly wrote, recorded, and released <em>“Devils Cast Long Shadows”</em> in 2018 as an outlet to continue creating new music together. Since then, they’ve had the opportunity to tour with some incredible bands, including <strong>Portrayal of Guilt</strong>, <strong>Darkest Hour</strong>, <strong>The Hirs Collective</strong> and more. In their follow up record<em> “Erase,”</em> the band solidified their sound, blending mean chaotic punk that occasionally comes up for air with haunting, melodic breaks.</p>

<p><strong>OATS</strong> (Amsterdam, mathcore)<br>
The Amsterdam punk act <strong>OATS</strong> have recently released their third single. <strong>OATS</strong> showcase their propensity to experiment and blend genres, from neo-soul to hardcore-punk, and pushing the boundaries of aggressive music by creating an explosion of tenderness and gut-churning fury that packs a punch. The song starts with a fast-paced bassline that’s swiftly accompanied by pounding drums, angular guitars and a distorted Alto Saxophone delivered by up-and-coming Jazz artist <strong>Miguel Valente</strong> (<strong>Nausyqa</strong>, <strong>YOPE</strong>). But around the 2 minute mark the band surprises us by delivering a velvety smooth Neo-Soul section, with a sax solo as the cherry on top, before unleashing the final act of the song.</p>
