<p><strong>We Beat On Our Chest While We Whale</strong><br>
Queer is not a Manifesto x Raoni Muzho Saleh</p>
<p>-* .<br>
The desire is to create a mini rave setting where we groove together while honoring the beauty of our voices and the pain of voicelessness. It is to celebrate that we have bodies through which we find relation and the pleasure of connection.<br>
We will do some voice and body exercises, after that there will be a live performance by Abel Kroon and Raoni Muzho Saleh. You are invited to participate or just join as an observer.<br>
For this moment in practice, Abel and Raoni have collaborated on a soundtrack that combines Raoni’s insistence on moaning in togetherness and Abel’s fascination with unstable ambient works.<br>
*Chest-beating is originally a mourning ritual practiced in various cultures.<br>
Performance: Raoni Muzho Saleh<br>
ᑕomposer: Abel Kroon</p>
<p>Entrance: 3 – 10 euro Sliding Scale<br>
BIPOC, refugees, trans and/ or queer crew will never be denied entrance due to lack of funds.</p>
