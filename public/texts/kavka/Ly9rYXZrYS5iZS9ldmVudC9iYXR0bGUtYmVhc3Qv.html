					<p>Get ready for some Finish heavy metal beasts, because on 23 November Battle Beast is coming to Zappa, Antwerp! In 2022 the band with frontwoman, Noora Louhimo, released their sixth studio record “Circus of Doom”, which featured nothing but no nonsense heavy metal tracks. So get ready for an evening filled with intense heavy metal to bang your heads to because the circus is coming to town!</p>
