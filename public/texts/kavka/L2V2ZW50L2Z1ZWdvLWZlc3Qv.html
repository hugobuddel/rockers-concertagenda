The five-piece has played multiple major festivals in Europe. With a reputation for energetic and furious live performances, they always deliver an unforgettable intense experience. Their live shows are a celebration of life, serving as a vessel for the band to let go of negative energy and inspire a shift in perspective. They stand up for what they believe in and hope to broaden their audience’s views through critical thinking and messages of tolerance, acceptance, and trust.<br>
Their previous albums, “Human Entropy” and “Enlightenment,” were well received and highly praised within the melodic death metal scene.</p>
<p>DESTROY HUMANITY<br>
Originating from a tiny town in Belgium, called Beerzel, this three-headed metal collective brings their own take on groove metal. Heavily influenced by Pantera, Machine Head and Lamb Of God, they blast away with their gnarly riffs and pounding beats. Hardcore enough for the fans of Pro-Pain, raw enough to please Pantera fans.</p>
<p>FABULAE DRAMATIS<br>
is a Metal act of heavy world music that takes the audience on a journey with different passages full of heaviness, intensity, and dramatism. The band has a sound that is both vast and intimate, one that transcends the traditional boundaries of the genre.<br>

Their music was described by Classic Rock Society magazine as having “deep thought and insular attention” paid to it with “the spirits of Zappa and Beefheart”.</p>
<p>INHUMAN<br>
A LOUD, SYMPHONIC BULLDOZER.<br>
InHuman make symphonies for those who want to roar.<br>
Intense, filling and filled: InHuman combines Machine Head’s raw energy, Devin Townsend’s theatrical choruses and imposing Dimmu-Borgir like orchestrations.<br>
Double-bass drums crushing like a hammer, massive cinematic orchestrations and catchy choruses in an uncompromising production of violence.<br>
Proving once and for all symphonic metal does not have to be gentle, nor sweet.</p>
