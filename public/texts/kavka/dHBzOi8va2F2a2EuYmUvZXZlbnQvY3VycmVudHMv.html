					<p>CURRENTS is presenting us their new album THE DEATH WE SEEK live in Antwerp with support from BEING AS AN OCEAN, OCEANS ATE ALASKA and SENTINELS.<br>
Connecticut post-metalcore innovators Currents don’t pretend that life is a bed of well-manicured roses. Rather, it has been by way of exploring the forbidden realms of a tortured psyche and ferociously searching for meaning amidst uncertain chaos that the band has won the hearts of metal fans across the globe. Their new album THE DEATH WE SEEK sounds more angsty and heavy than ever. It’s a show of hands of what this band is setting out the achieve.<br>
Main support BEING AS AN OCEAN have been pioneers in the melodic hardcore scene for a while now, celebrating the 10th anniversary of their critically acclaimed record “Dear G_d” in 2022. 2024 also brings a new record for them, which will be released just in time for this tour!<br>
Concluding the line-up for this show are OCEANS ATE ALASKA and SENTINELS.</p>
