      Get ready for some Finish heavy metal beasts, because on 23 November
      Battle Beast is coming to Zappa, Antwerp! In 2022 the band with
      frontwoman, Noora Louhimo, released their sixth studio record “Circus of
      Doom”, which featured nothing but no nonsense heavy metal tracks. So get
      ready for an evening filled with intense heavy metal to bang your heads to
      because the circus is coming to town!
