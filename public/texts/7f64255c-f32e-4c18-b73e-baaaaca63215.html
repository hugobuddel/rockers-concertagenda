<p>Spitskop is a celebration of breaking predictability, routine and rules. It is about being analog in digital days. Spitskop is an evening, a night, a bar, live music, record spinners, and you (dancing). A party anticipating friction in honor of counter culture. Let’s rejoice and experience music once more.</p>
<p>Line up:<br>
Pol<br>
are two siblings inspired by new wave and the 80s in general with artists such as Visage, The Cure, Japan, New Order, Depeche Mode and Duran Duran. In their work they try to replace digitally produced sounds for analog synths and drum machine samples. Some of their work is mixed by Dave Bascombe (Depeche Mode, Tears For Fears, Erasure).</p>

<p>Frankie Teardrop<br>
is a synth-punk rock trio who decided that the best way to channel incredulity and frustration is through music; loud, uncompromised and catchy. The message they spread? A humorous, cynical point of view on the mad, mad modern world. On the 6th of July 2022 they released their first full Length album “Punk Deluxe”<br>
