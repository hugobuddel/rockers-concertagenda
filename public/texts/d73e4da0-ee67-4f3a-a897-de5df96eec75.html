  On 27 October Death Angel and Sacred Reich andare coming to Zappa, Antwerp for
  an evening of unrelentless thrash metal! While both bands no party of The Big
  Four, they certainly are contenders for one of the remaining six spots of the
  “Big Ten”. Special guests that evening are Spanish thrashers Angelus Apatrida.
