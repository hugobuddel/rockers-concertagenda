			<p><strong>Harp Twins</strong><br>Identical twin harpists Camille and Kennerly Kitt, known as the HARP TWINS, have achieved extraordinary success by taking Electric Harps and Concert Grand Harps to unprecedented levels and smashing boundaries between different genres of music. The twins’ ability to reinvent the harp has given them the opportunity to represent the United States at four different World Harp Festivals and tour their live show worldwide. The duo has amassed over 2.5 million fans across their social media sites and over 150 million views on their YouTube music videos, making Camille and Kennerly the most followed and recognizable harp duo in the world. Their stunning live show featuring virtuoso harp arrangements of rock, metal, and their own Nordic Celtic originals comes to a powerful finale as the Harp Twins are joined by the Volfgang Twins on double Viking Drums. The Harp Twins deliver exciting, comedic, and interactive performances audiences cannot forget!</p><p><strong>Volfgang Twins</strong><br>Drømil and Drømal Vølfgang are identical twin musicians, artists, and craftsmen. Inspired by nature, mythology, and their heritage, they express themselves through creation. The twins are multi-faceted artists who make primarily music, paintings and illustrations, and are skilled builders. They are also axe throwers and stunt men! Their artistic stylization and inspiration is derived from Norse Myth and fueled by their imagination.<br>Raised in the northern mountains, they have a strong background of life in nature. Forestry, farming, and survival are part of who they are. Nature inspires their arts, as well as tales of old myth and tribal legends. Norse stories have found have a place in their artistic visions and paintings.<br>Descendants of Germanic barbarians, Drømil and Drømal long to keep the arts of old alive. In fact, their family's stories tell of their ancestors successfully defeating the Roman invasions of the Black Forest in ancient Germania. Without the strength of their ancestors, we would not be here today, and they will never forget it. Their German physical family tree dates back to the early 1600's, with known family roots tracing as far back into the 1400's.</p><ul><li>special guest</li></ul>			</div>
