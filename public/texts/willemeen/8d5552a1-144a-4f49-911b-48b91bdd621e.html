			<p>**As Friends Rust **<br>Consisting of former members of <strong>Culture, Morning Again, Roosevelt, and Shai Hulud</strong>, the Gainesville, FL, troupe of As Friends Rust integrates their hybrid punk and emo influences to result in a styling of melodic hardcore. Although critically compared to the likes of <strong>Turning Point, Dag Nasty, and Avail</strong>, their lyrical dealings of personal relationships and how people interact with each other makes As Friends Rust stand out among their peers.</p><p><strong>Goodlife Records</strong> released the band's debut EP, The Fists of Time, in 1998, followed by the their self-titled full-length on <strong>Doghouse Records</strong> in 1999. A split with Discount was issued two years later, followed only months later by the full-length Won. The EP A Young Trophy Band in the Parlance of Our Times appeared in 2002 through <strong>Equal Vision</strong>.</p><p>In 2020, As Friends Rust released the EP, Up From the Muck, through <strong>Unity Worldwide Records</strong> and <strong>Stick to the Core Records</strong>, containing its first-recorded material in eighteen years. On June 22, 2023, the band announced that its <strong>sophomore full-length album, Any Joy, will be released on August 18, 2023</strong>, via <strong>End Hits Records</strong>.</p><p><strong>Don't Sleep</strong><br>Don't Sleep is a hardcore band from the East Coast that features **Dave Smalley (Dag Nasty, DYS, Down By Law, ALL) and members of The Commercials **(Blackout Records), Junction (Art Monk Construction) and Admiral. The band has releases on Mission Two, Reaper Records, and Unity Worldwide Records.</p><p>From being right in the middle at the birth of US hardcore punk with DYS to creating the blueprint of melodic hardcore with DAG NASTY, from helping to invent pop punk as we know it with ALL to finding himself in the middle of the west coast punk explosion of the 90s with DOWN BY LAW: Smalley was always on the forefront every time hardcore punk pushed its envelope.</p>			</div>
