			<p><strong>Methedrine</strong><br>The first idea of the Methedrine project takes form after ‘80s crossover/d-beat pioneers <strong>Upset Noise</strong> disbands after a brief reunion in 2017. Drummer Bone, singer Lou and recently acquired guitarist Mark start looking for new elements for a fresh start and a new band. They find them in Dario (guitar) and Bob (bass): the watchword are Motorhead, first thrash and HC attitude.<br>It’s Methedrine 2.0, that keeps up with the d-beat/crossover legacy, yet expanding their sonic landscape with darker and broader influences. A new full length Lp is out now!</p><p><strong>Circle Of Friends</strong><br>Melodic 4 piece HC/Punkrock band from The Netherlands. Established 1989. We are back!</p>			</div>
