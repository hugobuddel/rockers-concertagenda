BLACKFEST 10-02-2024 Willemeen Arnhem word een hele vette editie !!!<br>Uiteraard dikke namen uit binnen en buitenland, local heroes en upcoming sensations, maar vooral, gewoon weer een vet festival in Arnhem!!!</p><p>SAMMATH<br>Sammath started out as a Black Metal band formed by Jan Kruitwagen by the end of 1993 releasing 3 demos and 6 albums in 30 years. Folter Records 1997/2014 Hammerheart Records 2014.... The upcoming 7th album, Grebbeberg once again set in the horror of World War II, tells the story of Kruitwagens great-uncle who perrished in the forgotten battle of the “Grebbeberg” in 1940. A fitting title for an album showing Sammath at their peak. 30 years of experience in songwriting comes together in a perfect storm. Like a war hammer to the head, “Grebbeberg” is Black Metal which beats you into submission. It simultaneously provides the soundtrack to battle preparation and the triumph of victory in battle, all in a very ugly way. No matter how grand and unforgettably poetic folkloric depictions of Hell are, there is little prose aimed at the Underworld anywhere near as horrifying as the theater of war among men. No excuses, no reamping, no recording drums or guitars in segments. Blood, sweat and breathing extreme metal. “Grebbeberg” sees the band perfect the style they were championing on their previous two albums. A dynamic, tremelo filled glorious return to 90s Black Metal with a great strong production.</p><p>MISANTHROPIA<br>MISANTHROPIA started out with members from several bands from Gueldrian and Brabantian grounds (NL), but after several line – up changes, a stable one was found in 2014.

It handled stories about the American underworld from the roaring twenties until the end of The Great War and sometime thereafter.<br>With their latest addition CONVOY OF SICKNESS, they seem to build upon its predecessor, but the events and stories are from Dutch en Belgian grounds, that occurred during the late seventies until present day.<br>They worked closely with MIKE WEAD (King Diamond, Mercyful Fate a.o.) and SIMON JOHANSSON (Wolf, Soilwork). From SolnaSound Recording, they are responsible for the sound, mix, and mastering.<br>After each release, they worked hard to play live extensively, domestic and abroad.</p><p>MORIBUND OBLIVION (TUR)<br>Moribund Oblivion was founded in 1999 by Bahadir Uludaglar.
