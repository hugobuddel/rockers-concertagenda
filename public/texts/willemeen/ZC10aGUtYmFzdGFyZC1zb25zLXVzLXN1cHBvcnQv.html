			<p><strong>Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons  on tour to support their third album “Kings Of The Asylum”.</strong></p><p>Een unieke kans om een artiest van dit formaat in een intieme setting live te zien!</p><p>Shortly after the band announced to the world the recruitment of new powerhouse lead singer Joel Peters in January 2022, the band entered their studio at Stompbox Studios, South Wales, UK and began writing and recording the album at the beginning of 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>After putting the songwriting groundwork in throughout the Spring, the bastards then entered their busiest festival season to date including performances at major festivals such as Wacken Open Air, Hellfest, Graspop Metal Meeting and many more throughout the summer 2023.&nbsp;After the busy festival season the band then had time to reconvene to put the finishing touches on Kings Of The Asylum.</p><p>Phil Campbell, the former **Motörhead **guitarist of 32 years commented “It’s been a great experience writing this album alongside Joel and the rest of my lads. We’ve come up with some monstrous riffs and hooks for your listening pleasure. We can’t wait to play some of these songs at some of our old favourites towns and cities and visiting some new places too!”</p><p>Joel added “The band will release “Kings Of The Asylum” in the late summer of '23 via Nuclear Blast Records and will embark on the “Kings Of The Asylum” tour in September!”</p><p>Originally formed as a side project towards the last couple of years of Motörhead, the band decided to take it up a level and revealed the new name of PHIL CAMPBELL AND THE BASTARD SONS at Wacken Open Air 2016. Led by one of the genre’s most respected guitarists and completed by his sons Todd, Tyla and Dane the band emerged onto the 2017 touring circuit powered by a huge amount of good will, a smattering of MOTÖRHEAD covers and a handful of new songs that crackled with passion and swagger. Landing themselves a prestigious support slot on GUNS N’ ROSES 2017 summer stadium run, the BASTARD SONS hit the ground running.</p><p>By the time the band released their debut album, “The Age Of Absurdity”, in January 2018, this honest rock ‘n’ roll enterprise had organically blossomed into a pretty big deal. The album garnered widespread great reviews, picking up a trophy for ‘Best Debut Album’ at Metal Hammer Germany’s 2018 awards. Two years later, recorded and engineered during lockdown by guitarist Todd Campbell, the second album was just the tonic people needed. It’s called “We’re The Bastards” and it was bigger, better and even more raucously uplifting than its predecessor with top 40 national chart entries in 4 countries!</p>			</div>
