<h1>Geregeld Ontregeld is proud to present you Myles Bullen and Chris Conde’s Rainbow Chasers Europe Tour</h1>
<p><strong>Chris Conde</strong> (they/them) <em>“the most raw, brutal and incredible talent that US rap has produced in the last ten years”</em><br>
(Sun Burns Out, France) is a queer rapper currently based in Brooklyn, NY.<br>
<strong>Conde</strong> has teamed up with Portland, Maine soft-rap artist <strong>Myles Bullen</strong> (he/they)<em> “one of the most well-rounded talents in the scene right now”</em> (Teal Cheese, US) for a tour across Europe in Spring 2023.</p>
<p>Both artists first teamed up last Spring with a tour of the US West Coast, promoting their respective albums which came on the indie rap label<strong> Fake Four Inc</strong>. who are known for their punk-adjacent releases that often transcend the rap ethos.<br>
While <strong>Conde</strong> and <strong>Bullen</strong> at first glance may seem like an unlikely touring duo, their unabashedly vulnerable live shows make them a perfect pair for creating emotional and memorable experiences for their audiences.<br>
This was noted on their last tour together as they packed out rooms in Washington State and Northern California, rocked hip-hop heads in Berkley’s iconic punk venue <strong>924 Gilman</strong>, and converted new fans to their individual brands of indie hip-hop in Los Angeles to name a few highlights.</p>
