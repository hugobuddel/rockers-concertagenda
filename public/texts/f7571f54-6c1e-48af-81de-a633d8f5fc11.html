<p>After two years of absence Unlocking The Stellar Crypt is back with a last minute show. With great honour we will summon the gods of occult rock on the twelfth of january. Aluk Todolo is no stranger to the venue of dB’s having performed multiple seances on its stage throughout the years. Yet we are pleased to have them again together with the highly anticipated Sordide. Come join us at which might possibly be their last show on the current and loved location of dB’s.</p>
<p>Aluk Todolo (France – Occult Rock / Black Metal)<br>
With every following release Aluk Todolo dives deeper in the methodical exploration of the occult powers of musical trance. Combining krautrock’s strangeness with black metal’s coldness, Aluk Todolo conjures rabid obsessive rhythms and bizarre, black magick summonings. It’s secrets can only be revelead through live witness.</p>

<p>Sordide (France – Black Metal)<br>
Brings a fierce, esotheric and chaotic form of black metal. Sordide’s technical songwriting takes it in progressive and avant-garde directions without losing any of the vicious impact it has. Even hints of post-hardcore can be picked up in their buzzing, tri-vocal performance.</p>

<p>Dodenbezweerder (Netherlands – Black Metal)<br>
dodenbezweerder.bandcamp.com<br>
One of manyfold monikers Mories (Gnaw Their Tongues, De Magia Veterum, Hagetisse etc.) has embraced channeling his bleak and ominous sonic visions into this world. Together with drummer JG Dodenbezweerder creates a solemn, mid paced black terror reminding even of the long forgotten times of Aderlating.</p>
