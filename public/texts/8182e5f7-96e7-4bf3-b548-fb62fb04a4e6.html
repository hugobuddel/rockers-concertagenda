<p>ORPHANED LAND was formed in Israel in the spring of 1991 and is the Middle East’s largest and most influential metal band. Their music style is a mix of prog, death and doom metal, supplemented with influences from the Middle East. All their albums deal with themes such as contrasts between East and West, past and present, light and darkness and God and Satan. Recently their eighth studio album entitled ‘Unsung Prophets and Dead Messiah’ was released, this unique band is also on the road again.<br>
Those familiar with Orphaned Land now know that their live show is not just any concert, but a totally unique experience for everyone.</p>
