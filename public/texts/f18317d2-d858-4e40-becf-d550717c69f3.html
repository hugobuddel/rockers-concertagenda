<p>Geregeld Ontregeld is happy to present you a night combining the forces of synthtitans Rimojeki, De Kraters &amp; Rolodex.</p>
<p><strong>RIMOJEKI </strong>a.ka. The Giant Reptilians From Nibiru Planet (Berlin)<br>
RimoJeki is the groundbreaking, hair-raising, mind-blowing theatrical-musical show by Rimo &amp; Jeki: the power couple spent the last few years touring intensively all over Europe.<br>
Using heavy beats, stoner guitar riffs, wave synth, heavenly theremin sounds, outer space vocals and crazy video projections, RimoJeki sends the crowd on a trip through ancient mythologies and philosophies that always turns into a hardcore rave.</p>
<p><strong>ROLODEX</strong><br>
Unapologetically individual is a term that describes the A’dam-based band Rolodex to a T. The band combines influences from various genres including psychedelic rock, post-punk, latin and funk to create something completely new. Soaring synthesizers, driven guitars, tight grooving drums give Rolodex a distinct danceable sound with an edge.</p>
<p><strong>DE KRATERS</strong><br>
One Man Synthband dedicated to the golden age of analog electro. On a set of classic machines, they interweave explosive synthpunk with elemental Italo. Voices have been transformed into vocoder – megaphone – robots</p>
