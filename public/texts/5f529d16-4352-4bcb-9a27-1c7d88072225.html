<h3>SUNBURNED HAND OF THE MAN (US) + AJAY SAGGAR &amp; KOHHEI MATSUDA DUO</h3>
<p>free-rock collective | kraut, psych rock| counter culture</p>
<p>The real high and heavy returns to Amsterdam for the first time in more than a decade, as Western Massachusetts’ trouble troupe <strong>Sunburned Hand of the Man</strong> convene for a one-night stand at OCCii. A wildly versatile and prolific collective, Sunburned navigate many modes of total freedom. With flow itself at the core, they readily invent epic psych rock jams, issue alien rants atop laid back funks, and digress into the abstract fluidly. Over two decades the group has continually shifted shape, expanding and contracting, always picking up steam. … Bring another head, and slip under the counter culture.</p>

<h3><strong>Ajay Saggar &amp; Kohhei Matsuda Duo</strong></h3>
<p>Asian guitars bringing beauty and fury in equal combination sprinkled with the crackle and burn of sly electronica. Ajay and Kohhei have been playing together for over two years now and always carry a new sound and dynamic to every occasion. The sonic mantra never sounded stronger within this Indian / Japanese axis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Sunburned Hand of the Man (aka “Sunburned”) are a loose knit gang of musical artists from the wilds of Eastern Massachusetts. Founded as a way to let off steam from years of obsessive weirdo record collecting and perversely decoding the hand jive of wanton talents from the psychedelic and punk rock hardcore scenes in the Boston zone Sunburned was born to be awesome. The nucleus of the group is a small ragtag contingent of fascinants completely focused on the idea of spontaneous composition within the framework of religious experience: the rock n roll EVENT”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– Thurston Moore</p>
<p>Championed by the likes of Julian Cope, Michael Hurley, and Byron Coley, who once called them a “human zoo.”</p>
