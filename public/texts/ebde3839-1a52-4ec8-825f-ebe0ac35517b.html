Dreaming Demons</strong></p>
<p>Leffe Goldstein presents an alternative future perspective. HIs drawings are a black and white vision of an absurd world where people no longer house. A world where only their demons survived. He is intrigued by places once full of life and loved by its inhabitants and its builders. The drawings consist of real existing places or objects. It could be buildings or pieces of machinery, planes, helicopters and cars left alone to decay. Objects that were invented and build by real hands by real people and were full of life. These people are no longer there and might be long forgotten. But take a good look and you can see their demons are still in there, breeding an alternative future.</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúMost people see demons as their wildest fears while others seem to enjoy them but the lucky ones have both.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Leffe Goldstein always starts sketching with pencil but the finished black and white works are drawn digital. He uses the sketch as an under-layer and starts working endlessly on details to bring the demons a life. When finished they are being printed as silkscreen print, or a Gicl√©e this is an art print that is far superior to all other forms of reproduction printing. The larger prints in this series are printed on Dibond.</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúCherish your demons while you can.‚Äù</em></p>
