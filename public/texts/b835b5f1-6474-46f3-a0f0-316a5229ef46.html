<p><strong>HEZ</strong><br>
Raw Dark Hardcore Punk outta Panama<br>
“Tormented vocals echo over distorted bass and psyched-out guitars, bouncing between grooving moshy parts and stomping 1-2 1-2 beats. <strong>HEZ</strong> continue to prove themselves to be one of the best contemporary hc-punk bands on a world scale. Coming from a local history of punk that goes back to the mid-late 80s, <strong>HEZ</strong> builds upon that criminally overlooked scene and creates something that sets an example for the world to take note; punk, and incredible punk at that, happens all over the world, and it’s time to look past the hype machines of the Western First World countries and see that the rest of the world is creating music just as ferocious, original and maybe even more relevant.”<br>
