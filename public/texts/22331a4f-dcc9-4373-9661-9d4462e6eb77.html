<p><strong>ALTO FUERO</strong><br>
————–<br>
“Heady vocals, synthetic Andean flutes, otherworldly percussion and hand-played reggaeton, the duo <strong>Alto Fuero</strong> invents a world music from an imaginary world and stretches the notion of folklore in all directions. Formed by <strong>Victoria Palacios</strong> and<strong> Loto Retina</strong>, two artists who express themselves as much in the visual arts as in music, the group makes each of its stage appearances a unique performance. And they succeed in linking avant-garde and popular cultures. ”</p>

<p><strong>Bathtub (Robert Bergman &amp; TBZ)</strong><br>
———————————————<br>
Together the super team of <strong>Robert Bergman </strong>&amp; <strong>TBZ</strong> create oddly formed dancemusic for night scrubbing. This is high voltage machine grime channeled to go straight down the plughole. Danger. Both very active solo musicians – it’s a rare treat to catch these two performing together live. Make sure you are there for the soundcheck.<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" seamless="" data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1379460595/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=1596739351/transparent=true/" class="lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><a href="https://occii.bandcamp.com/album/occii-compilation-deluxe-edition">OCCii Compilation Deluxe Edition by Various Artists</a></iframe></p>

<p><strong>5PS</strong><br>
—–<br>
<strong>5PS</strong> is a sound collage project from artist <strong>James Grunfeld</strong>. His work involves recording various industrial materials put under different levels of stress and tension. This is the debut presentation of the project and we can’t wait to hear it on the OCCii soundsystem. You might know <strong>James</strong>’s visual output from the <strong>Wah Wah Wino</strong> releases (a label he also records on as<strong> Gombeen &amp; Doygen</strong> with <strong>Morgan Buckley</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>DJ Meeuw (Meeuw Muzak)</strong><br>
————————————-<br>
<strong>The Meeuw Muzak</strong> label was founded during the mid 90s in Maastricht. After several years in Amsterdam the label found its current home in Brussels. The output has been stunning; releasing countless gems over the years ( including a stream of deadly Christmas singles). <strong>Meeuw</strong> is firm favorite of at OCCii. A strictly 7″ label and a MEAN 7″ DJ, <strong>Meeuw</strong> brings many styles.</p>
