<p>BLISSMAL PRESENTS: after more than two years, we are back! A night full of sounds like post-rock, post punk, shoegaze, noise pop, and everything fuzzy, noisy and wavy in between. </p>
<p>For this edition, we are very happy to have Deliluh from Toronto! But that’s not all, there’s more coming, yet to be announced…</p>
<p>Deliluh is an art-rock group at the centre of the west-Toronto DIY music community that has been discreetly gaining local attention on their own terms. Their shows mostly ignore the traditional circuit of bars and clubs, opting for more unconventional spaces like bakeries, libraries, veteran halls, apartments, and soon a dormant subway station. The core members are also responsible for some of the city’s latest string of house shows, taking place in the living room of their Bloordale apartment; a space known by many as Somewhere Else.</p>
<p>Post-punks Deliluh left Toronto in 2019 as a four-piece and have now resurfaced somewhere unspecified in Europe as a duo. They’ve chronicled this period of transition by releasing two recordings of new single “Amulet,” one with the previous lineup and one with the current lineup. Both versions of the track are available on streaming services now, and they will be available on 10-inch vinyl via Tin Angel Records on August 20.</p>
<p>“Amulet A,” the quartet version, initially belies its full-band composition with its simmering, minimalist intro, featuring little more than Kyle Knapp’s creaking, ominous vocals and snaking synths, before succumbing to a Nick Cave-like squall of violins underscored by thunderclap percussion.</p>
<p>“Amulet B,” recorded by Deliluh’s current membership of Knapp and Julius Pedersen, takes a steadier approach, journeying through its synth-led motorik beat with the help of whirling keys and saxophones.</p>
<p>While they were in Toronto, Deliluh were innovators in utilizing the city’s existing spaces for concerts, including turning cafés, legion halls and library branches into temporary venues and helping to organize a 2018 CMW showcase in a decommissioned subway platform headlined by Fucked Up.</p>
