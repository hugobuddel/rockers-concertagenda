<p><strong>Death Angel:</strong><br>
“Death Angel is excited to share the news that we are coming back to Europe this fall! We are doing a co-headlining tour with our friends in Sacred Reich! We have played shows together, however this is actually the first time ever that we have toured together! This is going to be an epic thrash event, night after night, and we can’t wait! Rounding out the bill is Angelus Apatrida! So.. get there early because all three bands are going to bring it from the moment the lights go down! This is a show not to be missed!<br>
We’ll see you in the pit!</p>
<p>Cheers!”</p>

<p><strong>Sacred Reich:</strong><br>
“We are excited for this killer old school tour with Death Angel! I think the fans are going to have a great time with two headliner sets of OG thrash! I think Death Angel is one of the great live bands around. Along with special guests Angelus Apatrida it will be an awesome night of head banging, stage diving and pits. See you there!<br>
Peace”</p>
