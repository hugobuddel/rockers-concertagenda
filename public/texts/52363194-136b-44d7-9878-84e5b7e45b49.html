<p>– “A-katastasia”<br>
Do you see yourself on the tv screen<br>
Do you see yourself on the magazine<br>
Does it make you wanna scream?<br>
A-katastasia is depicting the tragedy of the unperishable consumerist dream through a visual essay. Q&amp;A will follow.</p>
<p>– “AMMOUDA” (world premiere)<br>
A dystopian short film</p>
<p>Ammouda: a place covered in sand, a sandy place<br>
An ever-changing landscape, sculpted both by nature and human interference, was the perfect setting for our group’s first filming effort.</p>
<p>– “Outer Space Kids” A documentary by George Gounezos</p>
<p>Two graffiti artists from a rural town, explore tunnels and convert abandoned factories to outdoor galleries. Their artistic creations are still unknown and well-hidden in old industrial structures across Greece. Distinct graffiti murals accompanied by personal experiences make this punk tale come alive.</p>
