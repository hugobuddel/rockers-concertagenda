<p>Noise Rock pioneers, <strong>Eric Paul</strong> (<strong>Arab On Radar</strong>, <strong>Chinese Stars</strong>, <strong>Doomsday Student</strong>), <strong>Paul Vieira</strong> (<strong>Chinese Stars</strong>, <strong>Doomsday Student</strong>), and <strong>Nathan Joyner</strong> (<strong>Some Girls</strong>, <strong>All Leather</strong>, <strong>Hot Nerds</strong>) venture through uncharted territory with their new band, <strong>Psychic Graveyard</strong>. <strong>Nathan Joyner’s</strong> grinding synths and “found sound” buries the seed of each song deep into the fertile ground – while <strong>Paul Vieira’s</strong> manic, fuzzed-out guitars and <strong>Eric Paul’s</strong> obsessive lyrics shower the proceedings with equal parts sunshine and rain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The sound of fireworks used as a musical instrument on <em>‘A Bluebird Vacation’</em> perfectly symbolizes the range of powers <strong>Psychic Graveyard</strong> wields. Pretty and enthusiastic if they want, but if they choose to get in your face, the sound of celebration becomes one of pain. … These songs are as messy as life itself, in all its stupid beauty.”</p>

<p><strong>Chiyoda Ku</strong>, the Bristol band known for their dynamic, gritty yet lusciously melodious sound is thrilled to announce the long-awaited release of their sophomore album, <em>‘Selecta Perspective’</em>, on April 21st, 2023. The record will be preceded by the lead single <em>“Deal With It”</em>, which is set for release on March 3rd, 2023.<br>
Now featuring vocals from <strong>Callum Oak</strong> the band’s sound has blossomed into a heavier, more intense machine. This album features intricate polyrhythms, broken grooves, and jagged riffs that will have you checking to make sure you haven’t broken a bone. While the album showcases the group’s heavy side, it still maintains the candidness and introspection of <strong>Chiyoda Ku’s</strong> earlier works. <strong>Chiyoda Ku</strong> are ravenous for the truth. The band went on hiatus after years of extensive touring around the UK and Europe, numerous festival appearances, van theft induced homelessness and a 3-boys-1-room living arrangement above a Bristol Dive bar. Living in different ends of the country, they were no longer talking, they had flat lined. Half way through the main world event, a faint pulse could be felt between them. After a back and forth the band decided to go for a 2 week writing holiday/lets make up session, this is where they wrote and fine tuned the album.</p>

<p>To Celebrate the release of <em>‘Selecta Perspective’</em>, <strong>Chiyoda Ku</strong> will be playing a very special release show at <strong>Strange Brew</strong> in Bristol before embarking on a tour around the UK and Europe.</p>

<p><strong>ORANGE SWAN</strong> is an instrumental 4 piece from Germany and Ireland.<br>
Between playful progressive rock, brutal stoner-doom riffing, atmospheric and psychedelic sounds, the German-Irish instrumental band tosses diverse perspectives on the genre (post) rock. As different as the band members are, their music also varies itself in the most different directions without losing its form. Numerous concerts with regional and international bands took them to desecrated churches, demolished industrial ruins and the finest clubs in Basel. They released several cassettes – including their debut <em>‘SEALED’</em> in 2015 – and took part in a variety of sampler contributions and furthermore cooperated with two Artzines.<br>
The band stood in front of the camera for <strong>the Cardinal Sessions</strong> in 2018 and played at <strong>the Open Source Festival</strong> in the same year. In late 2019 the release of their second album <em>‘PERSPECTIVES’</em> marked another milestone, just before the times of pandemic. Since it has been possible again, they have been playing live shows again. In 2022 they opened<strong> the Traumzeit Festival</strong>.</p>
