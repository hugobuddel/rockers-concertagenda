<p><strong>Helaas hebben we bericht ontvangen dat <span class="s4swhuz0 rifmn7f6" spellcheck="false">Crossfaith</span> hun Europese tour gecancelled heeft en daardoor ook de show in Eindhoven niet doorgaat. Ticket ontvangers ontvangen binnenkort bericht vanuit Ticketmaster over het ontvangen van een refund.</strong></p>
<p>Statement Crossfaith:<br>
Thank you for your continued support of Crossfaith.<br>
This is a sudden announcement, but we are currently in a situation<br>
where it is difficult for the band to continue our live shows, and after multiple discussions, we have come to the decision to suspend our live and touring for the time being.</p>
<p>Therefore, the upcoming world tour will be cancelled and we are going to try to plan another tour hopefully in 2023.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the worry and inconvenience this may cause to our fans and all those who have been looking forward to our shows.</p>
<p>In the meantime, refunds for tickets &amp; VIP will be made automatically to the method of payment used to purchase.</p>
<p>Although we have no prospect for the resumption of live performances as of today. We will announce new plans to return as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding. We will be back.</p>
<p>See you in da pit!<br>
Crossfaith</p>
