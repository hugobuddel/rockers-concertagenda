 <p>The band was formed in Santiago in early 2013 by experienced musicians within the metal scene in order to develop a subgenre of black metal scarcely explored in Chile. In 2014, the band released its first EP through the Chinese label Pest Productions, which was later reissued on cassette by the U.S. label Graven Earth Records. In 2016, Sol Sistere released its debut full-length album through the renowned Dutch label Hammerheart Records in digipak and vinyl formats. It would also be later re-released on cassette by Graven Earth Records. The following year, in 2017, the group embarked on its first European tour, covering the countries of Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria and Lithuania, the latter being home of Devilstone, one of Europe’s largest metal festivals. During 2018, the band kept playing live in different cities in Chile and entered the studio to prepare the second full-length album, which was finally released in May 2019 through Hammerheart Records. In June of that year, the band embarked again on a European tour to promote the new album on 7 dates throughout Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, including a presentation at the tenth version of the Dark Troll festival in Germany. In March 2020, Sol Sistere toured Colombia as opening act for Polish force Mgła. They were signed by London-based label Cult of Parthenope for the release of their third full-length, a self-titled album, on October 15.</p>
