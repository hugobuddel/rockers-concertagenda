<p>BAGDADDY RECORDS X OCCII PRESENTS:<br>
Ryskinder (BLN) Stakattak (BXL) Nat Bed (AX)<br>
Political. Sexy. Unhinged. | Dutch. Hebrew. English. French. </p>
<p>Genre Defying and explosive, Ryskinder melts together psych rock, hip hop and electronic music. Pulsing with powerful groove, loopy Hebrew rap and lyrics touching both the political and the surreal in a trademark poetic style.<br>
Trashpop family-trio Stakattak takes the stage with a stripped down set and a raw and agressive performance that is drenched in abrasive grooves and existential lyrics.<br>
If Mars had a soccer team, Nat Bed would be playing in their clubhouse. With unhinged mashups of pop songs they bring you riffs that hula hoop your hips and beats that rip up space suits.</p>
