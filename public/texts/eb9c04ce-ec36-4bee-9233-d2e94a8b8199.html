<p>About the film:</p>
<p>‘Waiting for the Bliep’ is an animation film that combines several techniques within the genre. The backgrounds are dioramas, scale models. The use of mirrors around the sets create a very wide view. Everything is built, nothing computer generated. Even the skies, seemingly realistic, consist of cotton wool and blue garbage bags.</p>
<p>Time Lapse and stop-motion techniques are used for capturing the background footage. Harsh realities such as melting ice-caps and plastic soup are reconstructed as miniature worlds. Characters in the film are created with 3D computer animation. They tell the story of a possible future.</p>
<p>It’s an unconventional mix that, even though totally different in style, seemingly blend together in this absurdistic electro musical fantasy.</p>
