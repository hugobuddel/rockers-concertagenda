<p>OTOMO YOSHIHIDE (JP) + SACHIKO M (JP) &amp; CHRIS PITSIOKOS (US) + JASPER STADHOUDERS &amp; ONNO GOVAERT</p>
<p>Turntablist/guitarist Otomo Yoshihide, one of the most important members of the Japanese experimental/avant-garde, joins the ever genre-evading alto saxophonist/composer Chris Pitsiokos. The prodigious shared vocabulary of the two spans the gamut between noise, free jazz, musique concrete, and scronk. Indeed, whatever sounds lurk behind the next corner are always unknown, but paradoxically feel inevitable once they have happened.</p>
