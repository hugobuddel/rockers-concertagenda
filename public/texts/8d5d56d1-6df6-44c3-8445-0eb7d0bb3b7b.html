Living in Amsterdam, but hailing from Australia with Austrian parents, she is a bonafide human mongrel that has spelling and identity issues. It’s ok, she doesn’t bite, she only nibbles at your funny bone. She’ll tackle mental health, have a live panic attack and talk about anything to do with the butt - she’s a derrière connoisseur. That was hard to spell. See you soon!</span></span></p>
