<p>HACKEDEPICCIOTTO (DE)<br>
Alexander Hacke (Einstürzende Neubauten) &amp; Danielle De Picciotto (Love Parade, Crime &amp; The City Solution)</p>
<p>Both are legends within the underground of the music world. This will be the couple’s first visit to Amsterdam since before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Hackedepicciotto consists of the spouses Alexander Hacke and Danielle de Picciotto. Their collaboration mainly consists of stirring soundscapes that mix acoustic instruments such as violin and swing with bass guitar and electronic sounds. As a result of Hackedepicciotto’s many nomadic travels, their music is exploratory and an image of the endless journey through landscapes and environments. They describe their music as “cinematic drone.” They have six albums under their belt, and the latest ‘The Silver Threshold’ is their most symphonic to date. The album encapsulates a rare moment of silence and reflection – and revolves around everything from love to the fragility of the world. In 2022 they will go on a European tour and present “The Silver Threshold” live, and in that connection they will pass by OCCii in Amsterdam, NL.</p>
<p><strong>Danielle de Picciotto</strong> moved to Berlin in 1987 to start <strong>Love Parade</strong>, and also became a collaborator of <strong>Gudrun Gut</strong>, member of legendary <strong>Crime &amp; The City Solution</strong> as well as Alexander’s partner in life.</p>
<p><strong>Alexander Hacke</strong> is the founder and bassist of <strong>Einstürzende Neubauten</strong>. He is also known for his work on Crime &amp; The City Solution and Risha (with David Eugene Edwards) along with many other projects.</p>
<p>Performances for Hackedepicciotto are, to say the least, intense.</p>
<p>Danielle specializes in unusual instruments such as the Hurdy Gurdy, auto harp and cemence in addition to playing violin and piano; Alexander is a master of bass guitar, guitar and drums. Together they create beautiful, existentialist, acoustic soundscapes, which roar and vibrate while shaking their audience, but in a delightful way.</p>

<p><strong>GLICE</strong><br>
Amsterdam-based duo Glice (Ruben Braeken and Melle Kromhout) produce dense, eclectic and often overwhelming experimental music. Their sound gets under the listener’s skin. In addition to debut album LIX (2015) and its follow-up CIELO (Narrominded, 2017), Glice released two tapes with labelmate Coen Oscar Polack (Narrominded, 2017/2019) and a trilogy of heavily edited live recordings called FLEISCH (Narrominded, 2016/2019). Double album PYRE (2021) is an exciting next step in her oeuvre</p>
