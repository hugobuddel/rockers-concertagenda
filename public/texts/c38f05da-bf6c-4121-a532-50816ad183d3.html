<p>LAG is a hacklab project coming out of the SLUG (Squatting Linux User Group) mesh.</p>
<p>Our main focus is the relationship between politics and technology, both at a practical and theoretical level.</p>
<p>At lag we are interested in ]hacking( and at the same time in questioning what hacking is. We started this place because we wanted a place to share similar interests with other people so feel free to pass by for: installing linux, discussing technical or theoretical ideas, fix your laptop, learn to weave, build a bike, find parts, learn how to encrypt data, make experiments, deconstruct apparatuses, drink coffee, read a book, write a paper, scan a book, look at stuff through a microscope, fix your clothes, share files, take things apart, present something, potter around, add things to this list and share knowledge in any other way you want.</p>
