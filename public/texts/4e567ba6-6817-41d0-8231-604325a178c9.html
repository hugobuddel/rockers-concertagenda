<div class="cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle">The band name and lyrics were originally derived from lore from the Halo franchise and since then the band’s subject matter has become more dark and personal while maintaining an element of fantasy and wonder. The band’s music is heavily built on various different genres of metal including death metal, black metal, symphonic metal, progressive metal, and metalcore.</div>

<div class="cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle">Emerging in 2010 amidst a sea of blackened deathcore, Australia’s AVERSIONS CROWN separated themselves from the rest with their visceral sense of the genre. Coming equipped with a variety of vocal patterns and brutal 8 string guitar work, their technically onerous sound has developed and become increasingly unique over time. Evolving through member changes, the band has finalized its superior lineup in the wake of their upcoming album “Hell Will Come For Us All,” due to be released on June 12th, 2020 via Nuclear Blast Records.</div>
