<p>Rebel Up! Soundclash night:</p>
<p>MONSIEUR DOUMANI (CY)<br>
Hailing from the island of Cyprus, the multi-award winning trio has been impressing audiences worldwide for the last ten years or so with music strongly rooted in the Eastern Mediterranean. Their music has been extensively presented on worldwide media and they participated in the most celebrated festivals such as ESNS, Womex, Womad, Sziget, Trans Musicales, to name only a few. While their lineup may sound unusual for a three-piece (tzouras – small bouzouki, trombone, acoustic guitar) <strong><a href="https://www.monsieurdoumani.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monsieur Doumani</a></strong> are using electronics, effects and loop pedals to venture into a world that is refreshing and exciting. Their fourth album released by the acclaimed Glitterbeat Records pushes their trademark Mediterranean sonics into a deep psychedelic and avant-folk direction. A danceable fever storm of stringed instruments, multi-layered singing and trombone-driven low end.</p>
