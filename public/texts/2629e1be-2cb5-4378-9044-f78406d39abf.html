<p>EP release party/Indie band night:</p>
<p>K-BOY EN DE GOEDZO JONGENS</p>
<p>Have you ever been screamed at by a sperm cell? Fans of kboy en de goedzo jongens have, recently (you could have been too, but you weren’t at their show in the Vondelbunker, whatever). But you can experience the same confusion during the release of their debut-ep MUKUS MENSENSLIJM!! Kboy en de goedzo jongens will play an extra long set of their signature childish post-punk not meant for children, with songs about fucking, crying, dying, and sexy people not replying. If you are a fan (with very low standards) of the B-52’s, the Garden, Crack Cloud, Jeffrey Lewis, Doe Maar or guybands with endless seas of guitar pedals in front of them, you will definitely have a.. time (we don’t offer refunds). GET SLIPPERY AND SLIMY WITH THEM, MUKUS IS WAITING FOR YOU IN THE PIT!!!!!!</p>

<p>QUINCY &amp; THE DAVID</p>
<p>Quincy &amp; The David is a brand new DIY band based in Zwolle. For lovers of (post-)punk, emotional sorrow, songs not longer than 3 minutes because you can’t concentrate, cute people, moshpits and screaming in a loving way. Combine that with a sound that’s heavily influenced by Goat Girl, Fontaines DC, The Cure and an inability to mix and master professionally, and you might get an idea of what they’re are all about. Just having released their debut album ‘Purple Moon, Yellow Sun’, this gig in OCCii will be their first live performance ever!!! You don’t wanna miss such an occasion, do you? See you in the pit with a smile and a tear x</p>

<p>POODLE</p>
<p>Poodle makes peculiar, uptempo songs with a good amount of percussion in the mix: this quintet from Rotterdam/Utrecht plays fluffy garage rock that makes you want to dance. With songs about young adult life: the world opens up to you and the opportunities seem to be there for the taking, and yet the uncertainty is greater than ever. But mostly, Poodle is about having fun and writing about whatever they want; pets, dentists and printer frustration for example. The music might remind you of Hinds, Wet leg, FIDLAR, FEET and Iguana Death Cult.</p>
