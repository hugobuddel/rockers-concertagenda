<p>Chain Whip<br>
For me it started in December 2019 when a developer unveiled a 5 million dollar chandelier to hang from the Granville Street Bridge – a testament to wealth and the city’s cluelessness. A smug fuck you on display for the world to ogle while people froze in sleeping bags underneath. That insult grew into something more tangible.<br>
2020 was the year that an ever-worsening overdose epidemic was too boring for most news cycles. We watched citizens of North America get murdered in real time by pigs. White supremacists marched in the streets, encouraged by their revered grifters. Major news corporations backed both on primetime while demonizing people for just wanting to stay alive.<br>
We sat back, depressed and tuned into the images. We wished that we could just pull the plug on the nightmare around us. We attended some demonstrations, organized some benefits. Stayed home and we drank and drugged. We tried to sleep away the reality. Just like pollution makes the sunsets richer, we danced that good beat; a dependable, monotonous, continuous death.<br>
It hasn’t quite come for us yet but we’re still dancing to that tune ever closer to the edge.<br>
Two Step To Hell. Meaner, faster, and a bit more pissed off.<br>

<p>Bootlicker<br>
It’s 2022 and Vancouver’s Bootlicker are back with their first European tour. Experimenting with various lineups and sounds since 2017, these 14 original tracks flesh out their most realized expression. Following four EP’s and two demos, their self-titled debut LP stays true to the noise cultivated in the previous offerings. That raw, blown-out production countered with clean guitar sound and Internationally-informed take on a UK82 delivery remains. Everything that made the band what they were on their previous output is polished into a ball of fire that will not be contained. There won’t be much left but scorched earth by the time it comes to rest.<br>
