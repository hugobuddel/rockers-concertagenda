<h1>An Evening With Secluded Bronte:: musik theatre from Hell</h1>
<p>The Anglo-Welsh trio have been together for 20 years. Since that time in 2002, they have continued to plough an idiosyncratic furrow into the heart of what one might call art-music.</p>
<p>Rock ‘n’ Roll, abstract noise, musique concrète, references to cinema and television, comedy, poetry, songs, sketches and theatre co-exist equally.</p>
<p><strong>Secluded Bronte</strong> mix composition with improvisation: their scores are open enough to permit surprise.</p>
<p>There is also an element of their work which can be best described as a forensic exploration of everyday objects. The sounds produced are placed on an equal footing with more conventional instrumentation: guitar, piano, synthesizer, percussion.</p>
<p>Secluded Bronte are:<br>
<strong>Adam Bohman</strong> – voice, home made string instruments, objects.<br>
<strong>Jonathan Bohman</strong> – voice, piano, electronics, objects, percussion.<br>
<strong>Richard Thomas</strong> – voice, guitars, bass, piano, synthesizers, harmonica, computer, drum machine, percussion, telephone</p>

<p><strong>Secluded Bronte</strong> formed in London and launched in New York City in 2002. Their music combines free improvisation, speech, musique concrète, pop, rock ‘n’ roll, music-theatre, expanded cinema… you name it. It’s heterogenous stuff.</p>
<p>A little namedropping might work better, because it is precisely this elusive quality that ensures that a very diverse list of top artists – a.o. <strong>Squarepusher</strong>, <strong>Stereolab</strong>, <strong>Felix Kubin</strong>, <strong>Jim O’Rourke</strong>, <strong>Add N To X</strong>, <strong>Royal Trux</strong>, <strong>Peter Strickland</strong>, <strong>Lol Coxhill</strong>, <strong>David Byrne</strong>, <strong>Björk</strong>, <strong>Iggy Pop</strong>, <strong>The Necks</strong>, <strong>Charles Hayward</strong>, <strong>Ken Campbell</strong>, <strong>Christian Marclay</strong> en<strong> Ilan Volkov</strong> – is very fond of them and enjoys working with them.</p>
<p><strong>Secluded Bronte</strong> have toured in the United States and throughout Europe. They have recorded live sessions for<strong> BBC Radio 3</strong>, <strong>WFMU</strong>, <strong>Concertzender</strong>, <strong>Resonance FM</strong>. <strong>Secluded Bronte</strong> have released six albums and two singles: <em>“Secluded in Jersey City”</em> (<strong>Pogus</strong>),<em> “Dark August Variations”</em> (<strong>Worm Records/K7-3</strong>), <em>“Ten Point Plan To Destroy Astrology”</em> (<strong>Singing Knives</strong>), <em>“For Entertainment Everyone Dies”</em> (<strong>Apolkalypso</strong>), <em>“Daughter Tunnel Sunlight”</em> (<strong>Ffordd Allan</strong>). In 2020 the group released two albums on <strong>the Ffordd Allan</strong> label, <em>“Magnetic Crochet”</em> and the live album <em>“Queen’s”</em>. In November a third album, <em>“The Horns of Andromeda”</em>, was released on <strong>Takuroku</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It’s hard to describe the raw, explosive audio art they perpetrate. Everyday objects and sounds are worked on until they become saturated with lurid suggestion, resulting in a bizarre, hysterical immediacy … in the traditions of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, the Bohman Brothers kitchen-sink realism laughs at the grand claims of lofty art. They will show you fear in a sponge from a drainer.” – Ben Watson in The Wire</p>

<p><strong>Secluded Bronte</strong> are a multi-faceted experimental trio whose work has embraced scrapheap musique concrete, clattering post-punk, spoken word, poetry, improvisation and more. Collected from a mixture of studio and live recording, this suite of perfectly planned mischief slips and slides between the physical and metaphysical, pathos and alien-abstraction, wry humour and obscenity – relishing in awkward dualities and eccentric imbalances. Tuneful ditties emerge before switching frame to an aural car crash. Shared refrains and in-jokes from live shows are unveiled, then jump gear to a <strong>Morricone</strong>-soundtracked car-chase. Listen close, arrange the junk and unpack the mystery.</p>
