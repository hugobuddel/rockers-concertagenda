                                    <p>Pidżama Porno was established in December 1987 on the initiative of Krzysztof Grabowski and Andrzej Kozakiewicz. In 1989, they recorded their first material, titled "Ulice jak stygmaty". The band made its debut at the Jarocin Festival in the 80s. In 1997, after a break, they returned with the album "Złodzieje zapalniczek", which turned out to be a hit and catapulted the band to the top of Polish rock music stars. For over 35 years of her career, Pidżama Porno has released 8 studio albums that have become part of the canon of Polish rock music and has played thousands of concerts on the most important stages in the country and abroad. The premiere of the latest album "PP" is scheduled for November 17, 2023.</p>
