<div class="cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle">“A biography of Berlin-based Vaagner should speak of both the label’s situatedness and lack of clear physical boundary in the current landscape of music labels. A rootedness further branching off in a family of experimental electronic labels, dealing in ambient, noise, and power electronics, and then again splintering away in a special kin releasing its music in physical formats. Vaagner’s situatedness, its inevitable presence, is one communicating its kinship through tenderness. It is an intimacy communicated in handling the contacts, making the tape copies, curating the artwork, sharing the narratives embedded in the music, the writing or commissioning of the descriptive texts – a list of behind the scenes work that characterize the diligence needed in the DIY scene.”</div>

<div class="cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle">Zenevloed has grown over the past years to be an international, transdisciplinary<br>
collective. We have continued to dedicate ourselves to presenting experimental music and art globally, in fitting contexts, reaching out to defining presences in the scene – based on qualitative output rather than amounts of clicks. Adhering to collaborative DIY/DIT ethics, networks have blossomed into friendships. In our 5 year anniversary we hone these connections by inviting close collaborators to exchange during concerts, radio shows, and events this year. And, as always, we will not get chased into the death drive of ‘performing’ in the scene.</div>

The first full-length collaboration between Burning Pyre and Canadian Rifles, “The Snipe &amp; The Clam” encapsulates a shared sensibility and vision. Initially seen together on the Vienna Press/Vaagner compilation “A Declaration” in 2019, which was followed up with a second piece last year on Burning Pyre’s Opal Tapes debut, “United Angels”, the two artists cultivate a unique aural world with a singular voice.<br>

Fortune’s Brine is a shared alias that is adopted by various Vaagner related artists for different projects, letting the music speak for itself without any certain predispositions towards the producer(s).<br>
