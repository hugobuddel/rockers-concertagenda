<p>KILLDREN (2-bit RavePunk, UK)<br>
Killdren are a two-bit rave-punk band with a smelly attitude who hail from Tunbridge Wells.<br>
Sitting uneasily between straight-up nihilism and fresh-faced naivety, Killdren pen politically charged slapstick anthems.<br>
They form the ideal soundtrack to the worst generation in history.<br>
