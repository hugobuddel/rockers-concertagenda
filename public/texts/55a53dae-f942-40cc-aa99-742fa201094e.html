<h1>BHAJAN BHOY &amp; HIS RAGA ARKESTRA + JOOST DIJKEMA + KURIOUS ORANJ (UK)</h1>
<p><strong>BHAJAN BHOY + HIS RAGA ARKESTRA</strong> – the <strong>Cardinal Fuzz</strong> / <strong>Feeding Tube Records</strong> recording artist brings his extended Raga Arkestra to the stage to share an evening of kaleidoscopic sonic excursions. The two albums released on March 10 (<em>“To Love Is To Love Vols.1+2”</em>) received heavyweight acclaim in publications such as <strong>Mojo </strong>( <em>“a unique soundworld broad enough to encompass wild psych-noise guitar, dream-pop lullabies, and futuristic drones with thrilling results”</em>) and <strong>Uncut</strong> (<em>“ambitious and flush with ideas…they’re fabulous albums”</em>) amongst many others! Now you get the chance to hear them in a live setting!</p>
<p><strong>JOOST DIJKEMA</strong> – Dijkema’s mesmerising guitar playing owes as much to the blues and jazz as it does to the mountain music of the USA. His incredible technical talents combine at the highest level with a freewheeling mind and improvising hands which magically conjure up a spellbinding set of tunes in which you can only be swept away by. In a fair world, Joost would be lauded by all and sundry all over the world. Luckily you still get the opportunity to see this talent at your doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>KURIOUS ORANJ</strong>…..4 young boys from Cardiff in Wales. Two are aged 14 and two are aged 15. They might be babes in arms, but their musical strength and dexterity belies their ages! Channeling the <em>“No Noo Yawk attitood”</em> with a blessed vision of their own, they meld the whip smart playing of <strong>Television</strong> with the raw power of <strong>Hüsker Dü</strong> into a brash and brilliant set of songs that leave ya grinning from ear to here! Don’t miss ‘em!!!!</p>
