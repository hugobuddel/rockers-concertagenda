<p>– <strong>Lamp of Murmuur</strong> –<br>
Hailing from Los Angeles, CA, Lamp of Murmuur has swept through the dark underground with fervour since its first appearing with a string of demos in 2019.</p>
<p>With three albums already under his belt, Lamp of Murmuur’s explorations in black metal stray enough to keep his approach fresh and mysterious, without compromising the extreme core of the project. Starting as a fairly orthodox one-man endeavor, it was soon apparent that behind the ghastly mist of rabid riffs and ominous synths there was a far more complex and enigmatic beast dancing behind a veil of shadows.</p>

<p><strong>– Invunche –</strong><br>
Dutch-Chilean band formed in 2012, combining elements of primitive punk, black metal and psychedelic rock. First emerging in the physical world in 2014 with its self titled debut, offering a unique take on minimalist <strong>Ildjarn</strong> worshipping sounds. In later releases the sound evolved into to its own musical entity, adding elements of krautrock, folk and psychedelia while retaining its energetic punk origins.</p>
<p>Rabid and relentless, <strong>Invunche</strong> seeks to pummel its listeners into psychedelic submission.</p>

<p><strong>– Faceless Entity –</strong><br>
Ultimately ritualistic in substance, untamed in praxis, the abyss takes form and onward emanates the wisdom of the dead. Contemplate life and death. Give in to the fear of the unknown and let that fear wreak mental havoc on your psyche. Breathe in slow; your imminent demise is just around the corner. Let us mourn for you. Forever mourning the dead and the living…</p>
