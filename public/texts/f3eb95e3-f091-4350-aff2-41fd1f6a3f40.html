<p><strong>Deze show is afgelast door gezondheidsredenen van Phil Mogg. Er komt geen vervangende datum.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Ticketkopers ontvangen een mail met meer info omtrent het retourneren van tickets.<br><br>Lees hier het statement van de band:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>'Bad news for all UFO fans: a few days ago, frontman Phil Mogg suffered a heart attack. The British singer extraordinaire has already undergone surgery. On Thursday September 1st, 2022 – after having performed several detailed examinations in the past days – the doctors pronounced a strict performance ban for Mogg until further notice. This is why the entire ‘Last Orders’ farewell tour, which was supposed to lead across Europe from October 15 to 29, 2022 before ending in Athens, had to be cancelled. </em></p>
<p><em>If and when the tour or – at the very least – individual shows can be made up for, is currently completely unclear and will depend on Mogg`s recovery, among other things. His rehabilitation therapy will be starting in about six weeks. According to the doctors, it is not yet possible to give any concrete statements about the duration and scope of the treatment.</em></p>
<p><em>For the time being, the last show of the English rock legend took place on July 16, 2022, at the ‘Lieder Am See’ festival (near Nuremberg). Originally, band members Phil Mogg, Vinnie Moore (guitar), Andy Parker (drums), Neil Carter (keyboard/guitar) and Rob De Luca (bass) were planning on starting rehearsals in a few days for the final concerts in their more than 50-year UFO career. Refunds will be available from the point of purchase.'</em></p>
