    <p>A new <strong>ZEA</strong> album will be out early November. <strong>Arnold de Boer</strong> has been touring a lot recently with <strong>Xavier Charles</strong> (clarinet), <strong>Harald Ausbø</strong> (cello) and <strong>Ineke Duivenvoorde</strong> (drums) who all appear on the new album and will join the show at <strong>OCCII</strong>. <em><a href="http://www.zea.dds.nl/">More info will follow soon</a>.</em></p>
<p>Special guests are <strong>RECEPTACLES</strong>, a no-wave, afro-beat, free jazz trio from Sweden run by <strong>Joe Williamson</strong> (bass, vocals), <strong>Anton Toorell</strong> (guitar) and <strong>Dennis Egberth</strong> (drums). They have harnessed an essence of spontaneity and in doing so have created something unique and completely their own. <strong>Receptacles</strong> wilfully instigate and manipulate an elasticity of form, key, tempo and metre. The absurdist, spoken-word lyrics act as the lynchpin in the reckless, hectic, headlong, joyful collision of rhythms and riffs. An anarchistic relationship to group dynamics ensures a strong, original, unified sound, where the sum is more than the parts, and yet the parts are more than the sum.<br>

<p><strong>DJ JUST REGARDS</strong> will welcome you, keep you moving and eventually make you dance like you’ve got ants in your pants with her collection of strange edge, ecletric, outernational anti realism, post industrial disco set.</p>
