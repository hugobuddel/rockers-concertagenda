<p><strong>WORLD PEACE</strong> (hardcore/powerviolence, Oakland, California)</p>
<p>If you’re at all invested in powerviolence, the hardcore subgenre built around fast and jarring bursts of aggression, then these are boom times. The Bay Area’s history of powerviolence runs deep with such bands as <strong>Spazz</strong>, <strong>Godstomper</strong>, and <strong>No Le$$</strong> all coming from the Northern California region.  is a kinda new band presenting their brand of low end violence. Featuring no guitars and track lengths averaging 30 seconds, <strong>WP</strong> examine the co-dependency of man and god through a “less is more” sonic approach. Elements of bands like <strong>Water Torture</strong>, <strong>Vaccine</strong>, and even <strong>Sissy Spacek</strong> can be detected, but this Oakland three-piece craft a sound wholly their own.</p>

<p><strong>XIAO</strong> (hardcore/powerviolence, Stokholm, Sweden)</p>
<p>Forming in the summer of 2019, is a Swedish hardcore band based out of Stockholm. The group is bringing forth a sound that can go from the hurried pacing of D-beat and power violence one moment, and slower and measured the next. <em>“It’s a mishmash of hardcore worship over the ages, we’re mostly inspired by early to mid-’00s bands like <strong>Mind Eraser</strong>, <strong>Coke Bust</strong>, <strong>Hatred Surge</strong>, and then some random stuff like <strong>Dismember</strong>, <strong>Minor Threat</strong>, and <strong>Converge</strong>. We like to let all of our inspirations peak through when writing songs!”</em> (<strong>No Echo</strong> interview). In other words; fast, intense, in your face hardcore/powerviolence/d-beat all the way from Stockholm. <strong>XIAO</strong> is a band not to be missed, delivering great shows all over Europe the last two years.</p>

<p><strong>TRAVØLTA </strong>(fastcore/powerviolence, Heultje, Belgium)<br>
‘kick straight to your teeth with their hi-octane blend of fastcore and power violence, sounded like a steroid version of bands like <strong>SEEIN RED</strong> and <strong>MANLIFTINGBANNER</strong> with the mandatory INFEST influence to square the circle. The humorous vibe doesn’t water down the political message and the energy flows from the speakers making you beg for more!’ (Selfmadegod Records)</p>
