            “a remarkable listen…There’s an unnerving magic and beauty that
            plays throughout their harsh noise, like a dense mist lifting off a
            still river….Through glowing stasis and solemn ceremony,
            <strong>Divide and Dissolve’s</strong> sonics of despair and
            destruction have been crafted into a remarkably life-affirming
            experience, and it’s never been more needed.” – ★★★★

          “<strong>Divide and Dissolve</strong> invest their dense and driven
          music with a unique perspective. These days, addressing race and
          gender in doom metal is considered extreme in itself; with
          <em>Gas Lit</em> the duo demonstrates that extremity is not just found
          through deftly executed blastbeats and downtuned riffs, but within the
          decision to create music that defies categorisation.” –

    <p><strong>DIVIDE AND DISSOLVE</strong> Australia</p>
    <p>
      From the early protest songs that came from the violent occupation of
      Turtle Island (so-called United States), through punk music’s fight
      against the system, art has always been at the forefront of societal
      change. Whether that be through pointed attacks or something more
      existential – sung quietly or performed as loud as can be – music
      continues to be a spring-board for collective resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, few bands use their voice and platform quite as powerfully as
      <strong>Divide and Dissolve</strong>. Mirroring the brash, bone-crushing
      potency of their dynamic Drone music, the formidable
      <strong>Divide And Dissolve</strong> carry their fight and ancestors fight
      forward each and every day, using the power of their performances to draw
      attention to the ongoing battle against systemic oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >“We would like to observe a radical shift in the current paradigm of
        complacency in regards to oppressive power dynamics, genocide, racism,
        white supremacy, and colonization,”</em
      >
      the band have previously said.
      <em
        >“To give weight and validation to voices that are traditionally
        misrepresented and criminalized before given a chance to speak.”</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Divide and Dissolve’s</strong> new and fourth album<em>
        Systemic</em
      >
      examines the systems that intrinsically bind us and calls for a system
      that facilitates life for everyone. It’s a message that fits with the
      band’s core intention: to make music that honours their ancestors and
      Indigenous land, to oppose white supremacy, and to work towards a future
      of Black and Indigenous liberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saxophonist and guitarist <strong>Takiaya Reed</strong> comments,<em>
        “This music is an acknowledgement of the dispossession that occurs due
        to colonial violence,”</em
      >
      She continues, “<em
        >The goal of the colonial project is to separate Indigenous people from
        their culture, their life force, their community and their traditions.
        The album is in direct opposition to this.”</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Like its predecessor <em>Gas Lit</em>, <em>Systemic</em> was produced by
      <strong>Ruban Neilson</strong> of
      <strong>Unknown Mortal Orchestra</strong> and arrives on all formats
      through <strong>Invada</strong> on 30th June 2023 and is preceded by the
      lead single/video<em> “Blood Quantum”</em> which calls into question the
      violent process of verification of Identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Divide and Dissolve</strong> are focused on Indigenous
      Sovereignty. <strong>Takiaya</strong> is Black and Cherokee, and
      <strong>Sylvie</strong> is Maori. As a duo they released two full length
      albums, <em>Basic</em> (2017) and <em>Abomination</em> (2018) through
      <strong>DERO Arcade</strong> before signing with
      <strong>Invada</strong> to release their widely acclaimed third album
      <em>Gas Lit</em> in 2021, which was hailed
      <strong>Mary Anne Hobbs’</strong> Album of the Year.
    </p>
    <p>
      A<em> Gas Lit</em> remix EP was released in 2021, including reworking of
      <strong>Divide and Dissolve’s</strong> music by
      <strong>Moor Mother</strong>, <strong>Chelsea Wolfe</strong> and
      <strong>Bearcat</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Divide and Dissolve</strong> toured throughout North America and
      Europe in 2022 supporting <strong>Low</strong> and performing headline
      dates and festival appearances and have live shows and festival
      appearances planned in support of <em>Systemic</em>, including appearances
      at <strong>Supersonic Festival</strong> and<strong>
        End of the Road</strong
      >. At this time, due to personal reasons, <strong>Sylvie</strong> will be
      stepping back from her duties performing live with the band.
