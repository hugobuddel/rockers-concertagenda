<h3><strong>The Homesick</strong></h3>
<p>Constant evolving. The musical road of Dokkumer outfit <strong>The Homesick</strong> keeps on taking twists and turns. Their critically acclaimed <em>‘The Big Exercise’</em> on <strong>Sub Pop</strong> was already moving away from their post-punk/dark pop sound. The cold Frisian sea winds, the empty town life was suddenly filled with baroque instrumentations and almost proggy influences. When <strong>COVID-19</strong> hit, it set the tone for another reinvention. Solo projects, new environments and a sea of time to rehearse. The strings disappeared and are now replaced by samplers, synths and mini-disc players.</p>
<p>Music you can dance to, heavy influenced by 80s dub, post-punk and filled with even more trippy sounds. You can hear bands like <strong>Animal Collective</strong>, <strong>Colourbox</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Tonnstartsbandht</strong> and the influence of a lot of house parties, but it is still undeniably <strong>The Homesick</strong> with their jibbery harmonizations, surprising chord progressions and playful dynamics. Their  is just out. You can experience it at the second night of <strong>Klonk</strong>, if they are not already moving in new directions.</p>
<h3><strong>Spullen</strong></h3>
<p><em>“Is this (g)old or can I throw it away?”</em></p>
<p>The debut of this half French, half Dutch quartet that is looking for meaning in the clutter of sound they encounter; to create music that belongs to everyone.</p>
<p>While combining electronic instruments, electric guitars &amp; classical vocals the group draws inspiration from minimal synth, no wave, opera and dub.</p>
<p>Hoarders never lose anything, so embrace the noise of your surroundings.</p>
<p>Rommel, zooi, troep, spullen.</p>
<h3><strong>Citruks</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Citruks</strong> is a musical project that originated over 3 years ago. The songs were written both in Overvecht and Amsterdam Noord. Music best described as Dutch songs, existing in a disruptive, awkward atmosphere. The songs, with echo’s of post punk, ambient, and the smartlap in them, consist out of broken rhythms, drumcomputers, and fragmented sounds. <strong>Citruks</strong> makes their debut at <strong>Klonk</strong> and brings their debut ep which will be released on cassette.</p>
