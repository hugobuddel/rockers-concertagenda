    <p><strong>The Meffs (UK)<br>
</strong><em>FFO: Amyl and the Sniffers, Bob Vylan, X Ray Spex, Idles.</em></p>
<p>Since exploding onto the UK scene in 2019, TheMeffs have built up a reputation as purveyors of frantic punk rock and an absolute must-see live sensation. Broken Britain Part 1 &amp; 2, the Frank Turner produced debut EPs have attracted attention from music lovers and industry pundits alike. Libertines frontman, Peter Doherty, asked The Meffs to open for him as part of his Battered Songbook Tour, followed by the first UK headline tour which saw the Meffs playing to fans in sold out venues across England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
