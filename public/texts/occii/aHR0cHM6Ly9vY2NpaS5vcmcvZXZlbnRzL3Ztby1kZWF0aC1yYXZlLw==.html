<p><strong>VMO </strong>(<span>Osaka, Japan</span>) is members of <strong>Vampillia</strong>, fronted by female vocalist <strong>“ZASTAR”</strong> and <strong>Kezzardrix</strong> doing live visuals, plus three strobe lights and a smoke machine. They are an art music project where techno, black metal, industrial and noise come together.</p>
<p><strong>VMO</strong>‘s show is the extreme side of art music. Visuals and intense mosh music invoke violent dancing on the floor and diving off the stage.<br>
It’s like<strong> black metal</strong> meets <strong>Kraftwerk</strong> and<strong> Aphex Twin</strong> is invaded by <strong>Bxurxum</strong>. The total power consumption of a <strong>VMO</strong> show is 5000 Watts! That is equivalent to 60 amplifiers! Large venues and Festival sets consume even more power!<br>
<strong>Chip King</strong> (<strong>THE BODY</strong>), and <strong>Attila Csihar</strong> (<strong>SUNN O))</strong>), <strong>MAYHEM</strong>) lend guest vocals to their first album <em>“Catastrophic Anonymous”</em>. – CD released on <strong>Virgin Babylon Records</strong> (led by <strong>World’s End Girlfriend</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>VMO</strong> a.k.a <strong>Violent Magic Orchestra</strong> will release the second single <em>“SUPERGAZE”</em> from the album <strong>“DEATH RAVE”</strong> scheduled to be released in the future from <strong>NEVER SLEEP</strong>.</p>
<p><em>“SUPERGAZE”</em> is a song that evokes dance and mosh and explodes with a beautiful crystal gaze noise/guitar and a violent beat that evokes the image of a blizzard running through outer space.</p>



<p>The music video, which will be premiered by <strong>CVLT Nation</strong> at the same time as the distribution, is a spectacularly insane video work by French visual artist <em>“Valnoir”</em> who has worked on jackets for <strong>Laibach</strong>, <strong>igorrr</strong>, <strong>Alcest</strong> and <strong>Led Zeppelin</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I decided to offer VMO to direct a music video for them because…. well, those are probably the most fucked up, unpredictable, no-limits, excentric band I’ve been fortunate enough to work with.<br>
I mean, you take the shittiest venue in the crappiest town, and they will transform it in a stroboscopic death arena filled with a horde of epileptic hakken-dancing cyborgs high on crystal meth+LSD.”<br>
– French visual artist “Valnoir”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Step inside the Death Rave as Violent Magic Orchestra’s unholy blend of black metal, industrial noise, and hardcore techgnosis turns your ear buds into ear enemies. The six-piece Japanese collective unbind brooding slabs of brutality from the Seventh Circle, abysmally vibrant terrors fine and dark. With their second album imminent on ’s NEVER SLEEP label (), get ready to open up the pit…” –</p>

<p><strong>Violent Magic Orchestra</strong> go big on their new single and conjure up a whole new sound with <strong>Gabber Eleganza</strong> on percussion.</p>
