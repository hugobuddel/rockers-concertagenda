    <p><strong>RAT CAGE</strong> (Sheffield, UK)<br>
Probably the greatest live band in hardcore right now that probably put out the greatest album you’re going to hear this year. Expose yourself to the maniacal cries of the critically-minded individual pushed to the absolute brink, copping rapid fire tidings of woe belted out by an unhinged unit who has finally ceased to give a fuck.<em> SAVAGE VISIONS</em> lashes out at times towards the not-too-distant sounds of <strong>VENOM</strong>, <strong>MIDNIGHT</strong> and later <strong>DARKTHRONE</strong>, expertly folding these riff expressions back in to the irresistibly dysfunctional bop of <strong>GBH</strong> and <strong>CRUCIFIX</strong>.<br>
</p>

<p><strong>TURQUOISE</strong> (Paris, FR)<br>
Totalitarian scandicore (with ex and current members of <strong>Barren?</strong>, <strong>Rats Blood</strong>, <strong>Krigskade</strong> and<strong> High-Vis</strong>). Brain-burning, face-melting raw punk madness. The semi-clean guitar attack makes the bass and drums feel more pummeling, not unlike Canadian D-beaters <strong>BOOTLICKER</strong>. The vocals are deep and burly, never relenting or modulating, so they hit like a bomb blast.<br>
</p>

<p><strong>OUST</strong> (Amsterdam/Nijmegen, NL)<br>
<strong>Oust</strong> is a new-ish outfit formed by people from <strong>Landverraad</strong>, <strong>Crevasse</strong>, <strong>Betercore</strong> or <strong>Human Needs</strong>. They play raw, ugly and fast hardcore you may admire in bands like <strong>Törsö</strong> or <strong>Slant</strong>. Give a listen to their self-titled debut or their 2021’s seven-inch <em>Never Trust a Politician</em> and expect an outburst of heavy sound, crushing riffs, fierce vocals and dystopian nihilism. And don’t miss them as they are (in)famous for their crazy live shows.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>AZIJNPISSER</strong> (Eindhoven, NL)<br>
Classic 80’s style hardcore along the lines of <strong>BGK</strong> etc… In a world where the lines between subgenres can blur, <strong>AZIJNPISSER</strong> stands as a testament to the spirit of hardcore punk. A powerful punch to the gut that’s impossible to ignore. Are you ready to drink a cafè latte while listening to the song <em>Gentrification Hipstershit</em>? We sure are…<br>
