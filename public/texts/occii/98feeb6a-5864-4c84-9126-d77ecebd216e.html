<p><strong>SPLIT SYSTEM</strong> (AUS)</p>
<p>Melbourne punks from <strong>STIFF RICHARDS</strong>, <strong>SPEED WEEK</strong>, and the <strong>BLACK HEART DEATH CULT</strong> joined forces to form <strong>SPLIT SYSTEM</strong> during one of the breaks between their cityâ€™s COVID lockdowns.</p>

<p><strong>BURLERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>BURLERS</strong> is a Dutch four piece from Amsterdam/Horst. Their music merges traditional hardcore punk and garage punk, resulting in a fiery combination of razor-sharp riffs, thundering basslines, and frenzied energy. Plain and simple <strong>Burlers</strong> = a punk band.</p>
