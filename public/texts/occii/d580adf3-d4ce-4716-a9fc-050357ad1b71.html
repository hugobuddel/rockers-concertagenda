    <p><strong>DONNA CANDY (FR)</strong><br>
queer, drag, punk kinda thing from Marseille, <strong>Donna Candy</strong> lay out a heavy sound, trawled from the bizarre and sonic sub-genres of experimental rock.</p>
<p><strong>Donna Candy</strong>, the bass-vocal-drums trio trawled from the sub genres of experimental rock and busy pushing to the front of heavy music. Nu metal bass riffs, switch-pitched fuzz vocals and big, splashy drums layer over unsettling narratives and extreme loops to bring a bit of the pit to the dancefloor.<br>
<strong>Alex</strong> (drums), <strong>Js Donny</strong> (bass), <strong>Nadja Meier</strong> (vocal)</p>
<p>Begun as an off the cuff party band with the idea of finding a live sound that would fit between 4am trance sets, the trio soon found themselves addicted to the euphoric sludge they created. Swapping their usual guitar for a bass, <strong>JS Donny</strong> drives <strong>Donna Candy</strong> with simple riffs, split half clean and half shredded with <strong>Boris</strong> / <strong>Sunn O)))</strong> like distortion. Head-banging the whole way, they’ll switch speed or stop suddenly, bending and drawing out notes to ratchet things up for release. <strong>Nadja</strong>‘s vocals tear through the top layer – heavily processed and warped with weird imagery. Together there’s a feeling of what it might be like to see <strong>Sightings</strong> slowed by <strong>Codeine</strong> but with <strong>Elvin Brandi</strong> on the mic.</p>
<p>Always set up facing each other, off stage and surrounded by the audience, <strong>Donna Candy</strong> encourage catharsis – reciprocally transforming energy between themselves and the crowd. They build a <em>queer euphoria</em> that pulls apart metal’s narrow dichotomy of nihilistic machismo vs. hyperfemininity, and begins to make the visceral faux-hybridity of nineties nu metal feel possible this time around.<em> ‘Blooming’</em> brings us six offerings from the band on a four way split release that speaks for itself – once on board with the <strong>DC</strong> energy you’ll want to be a part of it.</p>

<strong>good read;</strong> <a href="https://thequietus.com/articles/32739-donna-candy-interview-counterflows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://thequietus.com/articles/32739-donna-candy-interview-counterflows</a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ottowillberg.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Otto Willberg</a> </strong>plays various bass instruments and lives in London. Live, <strong>Otto</strong> performs unashamedly melodic improvisational workouts created almost entirely with heavily filtered bass harmonica and electric bass. Strangely abstracted funk and fusion, a blend of the abstruse and immediate. silky smooth, luxurious, odd and compelling, <em>“like listening to <strong>Eberhard Weber</strong> through a drainpipe”</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Willberg</strong> is often heard on acoustic and electric bass in free improv settings and bands with <strong>Laurie Tompkins</strong> (<strong>Yes Indeed</strong>) and <strong>Charles Hayward</strong> (<strong>Abstract Concrete/</strong>/<strong>This Heat</strong>), as well as the fractured No Wave unit <strong>Historically Fucked</strong>. His previous solo releases have ranged from extended technique double bass to explorations of the acoustics of a 19th century artillery fort. Other recent and regular collaborators include <strong>Steve Noble</strong>, <strong>Pat Thomas</strong>, <strong>Jooklo Duo</strong>, <strong>Alex Ward</strong>, <strong>Hannah Marshall</strong> and <strong>Ashley Paul</strong>.</p>
<p>He has a solo record called <em>’The Leisure Principle’</em> out this September on <strong>Oren Ambarchi</strong>‘s the <strong>Black Truffle</strong> label. 6 unashamedly melodic &amp; profoundly strange workouts for heavily filtered bass harmonica &amp; electric bass!<br>
