      <strong>Nape Neck</strong> is a trio from Leeds (UK) playing post-punk
      that’s simultaneously tangled and taut, danceable and destructed, all
      while resisting any attempts to be easily situated as the latest addition
      to a specific geographic and genre-based continuum that stretches back to
      <strong>Gang of Four</strong> and <strong>Delta 5</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nape Neck’s</strong> knotted rhythms and the
      intersecting/overlapping vocal shouts from all three band members bring to
      mind <strong>Scissor Girls</strong> or <strong>Erase Errata</strong>, who
      also drew inspiration from the spiky tension of first wave UK post-punk
      and translated it through the more wild and free tendencies of
      <strong>DNA</strong>-descended downtown art-noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clipped Morse code rhythms and sharply punctuated lyrical declarations
      join forces with delirious, snaking guitar and duelling vocals which push
      against steady bass throb and stark, calculated beats as
      <strong>Nape Neck</strong> walk the tightrope between chaos and calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through extensive touring of Europe in other bands
      (<strong>Beards</strong>/<strong>Guttersnipe</strong>) the members of
      <strong>Nape Neck</strong> also bring a deep love for DIY sounds and
      connection, which shows in their organisation (both compositionally and
      operationally).
    </p>
    <p>
      is <strong>Claire Adams</strong> on bass guitar ,
      <strong>Bobby Glew</strong> on guitar and
      <strong>Kathy Grayon</strong> drums. They all sing.

      Hailing from Scotland, we find <strong>Comfort</strong>. presents an
      honest experience of dance, of groove, of liberation, of honesty and
      vulnerability. <strong>Comfort</strong> is <strong>Sean</strong> on drums
      and <strong>Natalie</strong> as energetic frontwoman. Weaving drums with
      piercing synths and weird samples, they create a world that is filled with
      built up emotions that release on stage. Engaging you in their personal
      story and protesting for queer liberation in a restricting society. Their
      live shows; infectious. A disarming, uncompromising energy that makes you
      want to dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      New release on <strong>Fat Cat Records</strong> and a videoclip that
      underlines their urgency, now happy to welcome them in
      <strong>OCCII</strong>.
