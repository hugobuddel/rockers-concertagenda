    <p><strong>MOCK EXECUTION</strong> // Raw Punk // Chicago, USA</p>
    <p>
      takes cues from the dirtier sides of both Finnish and Japanese hardcore
      while keeping their engineer boots firmly set on the traditional UK crust
      sound of yesteryear. Executing a magnificent hybrid of
      <strong>DOOM </strong>and <strong>GLOOM</strong>, <strong>GAI</strong>,
      <strong>KAAOS</strong>, and the entire early 2000’s
      <strong>Crust War</strong> catalogue, <strong>MOCK EXECUTION</strong> tear
      through flanger solos, huge crash cymbals, burly driven bass and
      <strong>NO SECURITY</strong> split era intros and that’s only part way to
      the band’s sound.

          focusing instead on communicating pure disgust for the rotting world
          around them.

    <p>
      – These Groningers know better than anyone that punk is a perfect outlet
      for pent-up feelings, abrasive traumas and dissatisfaction with life. They
      bite off wildly and meanwhile manage to turn the room into a swirling
      mass!<br />
      Anxiety fuelled Hardcore Punk that’ll put you in an existential dread and
      in the pit!!
