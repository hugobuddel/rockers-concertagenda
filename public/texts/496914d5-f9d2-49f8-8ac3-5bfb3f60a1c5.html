<p><strong>GEO</strong><br>
Life is beautifully strange and Geo embraces it with dancepunk from the cracks of the earth. Their self-titled EP is a cocktail of no wave, post-punk and weird funk, which is so addictive that Bandcamp decided to list it as essential release. Geo shapes an estranging world of mutant funk that is fueled by dissociative vocals. Here the grooves dictate the songs, while wired guitars and vexing synths keep them company. A surprising crossover between bands such as The Contortions, The Fall and Liquid Liquid. Please do come and dance to it.<br>

<p><strong>The Homesick</strong><br>
The Homesick is an arty &amp; posty punkband hailing from Dokkum.<br>
