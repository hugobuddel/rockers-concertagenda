<h1>The Dead C (NZ) + Roy Montgomery (NZ)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“In this writer’s opinion, <strong>The</strong> <strong>Dead C</strong> might just be the best rock act currently active.” – <strong>The Quietus</strong></p>

<p>Over the moon to bring the legendary New Zealand trio of <strong>Bruce Russell</strong>, <strong>Michael Morley</strong> and <strong>Robbie Yeats</strong>, <strong>The Dead C</strong>, to <strong>OCCii</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Dead C</strong>’s improvised noise rock verges on disintegration with a trademark hazy disorientation, invariably evoking hypnotic and heavy moods. But<strong> The Dead C </strong>are no bummer. They seek liberation from shallow and easy rock conventions; amid the murk of cardboard box guitars, underwater vocals, and ramshackle drumming, a new consciousness emerges. The recognizable, sullen strumming, mumbling and lyrical ennui of <strong>Michael Morley</strong>, anchored by percussionist <strong>Robbie Yeats</strong> and punctuated by the atonal bursts of <strong>Bruce Russell</strong> coalesce in a solid front that mocks the efforts of schmaltz-peddling hacks. – <strong>Starlight Furniture Co</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They truly are an act wholly unto themselves, never once letting their flirtations with structure or melody establish authority over their compositions, nor letting their mesh of noise-drenched improvisations drift into formless meandering.” – <strong>Tiny Mix Tapes</strong></p>
<p>“The New Zealand noise trio remain as vital, corrosive, and challenging as ever.” – <strong>Pitchfork</strong></p>

<p><strong>Roy Montgomery</strong></p>
<p>A key protagonist in the Christchurch 80s noise rock scene, his minimalist post-punk band <strong>The Pin Group</strong> were the first act to release on <strong>Flying Nun</strong> and lead to other explorations in short-lived drone project <strong>The Shallows</strong> and the gloriously open-ended freedoms of noise pop outfit <strong>Dadamah</strong>.</p>
<p>After a quiet spell, he returned in the late 90s, producing towering spires of guitar lines that exposed fragility between the strums. With his solo releases and in collaboration with <strong>Flying Saucer Attack</strong>, <strong>Bardo Pond</strong> (<strong>Hash Jar Tempo</strong>), and <strong>Chris Heaphy</strong> (<strong>Dissolve</strong>), his focus shifted from the truth-mining of rock music to epic celestialism. His ambitious yet humble tracks outstrip their origins, and <strong>Montgomery</strong> toured the world sitting cross-legged on the floor, playing twenty-plus-minute compositions.</p>
<p>A long period of silence followed, marked only with a split album with <strong>Grouper</strong> (who lists Montgomery as a primary influence), involvement in <strong>Torlesse Super Group</strong>, and a couple of thematic variations serving as soundtracks for films.</p>
<p>He unexpectedly re-emerged in 2016 with<strong> R M H Q</strong> (also know as Roy Montgomery’s Headquarters) on <strong>Grapefruit/Ba Da Bing</strong>, four albums of new material released simultaneously that marked a return to his distinctive pastoral guitar style but added the rare sound of his singing voice. Like all of his catalogue listening to his work is a visceral experience with repeating phrases swelling and decaying, immersing the listener in the cyclical narrative of his compositions.</p>
