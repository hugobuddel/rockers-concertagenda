<p>dUAS sEMIcOLCHEIAS iNVERTIDAS (Lisboa, Portugal)<br>
Formed in 2007 in Lisbon (Portugal), dSCi are a band with a curriculum as intense as their music, a unique blend of noise-rock, post-rock, post-punk and free-jazz that can be described as urgent, energetic and fierce or as once someone put it: “like a mix of Black Flag and Soft Machine”.<br>
After having celebrated their 15th anniversary in May, dUASsEMIcOLCHEIASiNVERTIDAS – dSCi are preparing the release of their new record “卌“, which will soon be out through Associação Terapêutica do Ruído – ATR (their siamese entity which is dedicated to promoting DIY concerts and to releasing and distributing records), together with the labels Bar Marfil Records, Experimentáculo Records, Gaffer Records, Lepers Produtcions, Neonparalleli, Red Wig, TECNOFOSSIL and Wallace Records.<br>
The 5-track EP includes the vocal participations of G.W. Sok (the ex-singer of The Ex and many other bands and projects).</p>
