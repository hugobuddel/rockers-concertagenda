      <strong>Lewsberg</strong> from <em>Rotterdam</em> are a four-piece rock
      group, named after writer and fellow Rotterdammer
      <strong>Robert Loesberg</strong>, famous for his dangerous novel
      <em>Enige Defecten</em> from 1974. This is one of the band’s main sources
      of inspiration: the counterculture and big-city cynicism of the 1960s and
      1970s. Yet there is also a softer side to
      <strong>Lewsberg’s</strong> music and lyrics. On their upcoming, fourth
      album <em>Out And About</em> (to be released on September 15th), this side
      is more present than ever. Rudimentary pop and rock songs are deliberately
      kept bare, only occasionally embellished with a violin or organ part. In
      the lyrics, the tendency towards existentialism and black humour is
      nuanced with an almost naive openness and engagement.
      <strong>Lewsberg</strong> are: <strong>Shalita Dietrich</strong> (vocals,
      bass guitar), <strong>Michiel Klein</strong> (guitar),
      <strong>Marrit Meinema</strong> (vocals, drums) and
      <strong>Arie van Vliet</strong> (vocals, guitar, violin).
