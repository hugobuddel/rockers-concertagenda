<p>OCCII prepares for a night of psyched-up and stretched-out jazz, dubby new wave experiments and krautronic abstractions, as Amsterdam label South of North invites a selection of musicians to convene on Amstelveenseweg.</p>

<p>Goya and Madba aka IC-RED bring their wavey beats and playful synth lines, drum loops and loose rhymes about modern life and heartache, criss-crossing between Maastricht and Amsterdam as featured on their forthcoming tape GOODFUN.</p>
<p>Fizzy Veins cobbles together a mutant child of percussion loops, spaced out synths, springy guitars and field recordings straight from the horse’s mouth. Part improv, part playback, all meander – the long distance storyteller searches for some effervescent narratives from deep within his own Furman reverb.</p>
<p>Nasssau’s 8-strong band of freewheeling jazz players first began back in 2015 at the Makroscope Art Center in Mühlheim an der Ruhr, and have captured several tapes of pastoral experiments with strings, synths, rhythm section, percussion and voice through the years. Nasssau were looking for a special environment to record their celestial improvisations, and a residency at the OCCII was the perfect solution.</p>
<p>Devon Rexi present their no-wave digi hybrids, and invited special guests Lyckle de Jong, Marnix Mauskovic and Ronald Langestraat to the party, with added dubs on the mixer from the Cologne Wizard. Nushin Naini taps into the language of the in-between-worlds, playing bass and singing in fried Farsi-like vocals, while Nicolini steps up on drums, sax and miscellaneous objects.</p>
