<p><strong>VMO</strong> is members of <strong>Vampillia</strong>, fronted by female vocalist <strong>“ZASTAR”</strong> and <strong>Kezzardrix </strong>doing live visuals, plus three strobe lights and a smoke machine. They are an art music project where techno, black metal, industrial and noise come together.</p>
<p><strong>VMO</strong>‘s show is the extreme side of art music. Visuals and intense mosh music invoke violent dancing on the floor and diving off the stage.<br>
It’s like <strong>black metal</strong> meets <strong>Kraftwerk</strong> and <strong>Aphex Twin</strong> is invaded by <strong>Bxurxum</strong>. The total power consumption of a <strong>VMO</strong> show is 5000 Watts! That is equivalent to 60 amplifiers! Large venues and Festival sets consume even more power!<br>
<strong>Chip King</strong> (<strong>THE BODY</strong>), and <strong>Attila Csihar</strong> (<strong>SUNN O)))</strong>, <strong>MAYHEM</strong>) lend guest vocals to their first album <em>“Catastrophic Anonymous”</em>. – CD released on Virgin Babylon Records (led by <strong>World’s End Girlfriend</strong>). Vinyl by Throatruiner Records, (a subsidiary of <strong>CONVERGE</strong>‘s <strong>DEATHWISH</strong>).</p>

Bringing together members the 10-piece “brutal orchestra” Vampillia, including Mongo and front woman Zastar, as well as visual artist and programmer Kezzardrix, the group’s first live performance since lockdown began in Osaka took the form of a ferocious and cathartic musical ritual. Looking forward to the near future, Ritual 2099 sees the group combining pummelling blast beats, euphoric, soaring synth lines and cavernous industrial noise, providing formidable sonic architecture for Zastar’s scorched-earth vocal delivery. As VMO assert, “music should be evocative and symbiotic of the current social climate”. Every second of frustration and angst experienced by the members of Violent Magic Orchestra over the last few months rises to the surface during Ritual 2099, brought to life by the esoteric visuals of Kezzardrix, who performs live with the band, conducting the visual landscape of VMO as they play. The performance arrives following the release of Principle of Light Speed Invariance, a new EP from the group for Gabber Eleganza‘s Never Sleep imprint. Principle of Light Speed Invariance is out now. For more information about Violent Magic Orchestra, you can visit the group’s website, follow them on Instagram., where you can also find Zastar and Mongo."></p></div>

<p>“Step inside the Death Rave as Violent Magic Orchestra’s unholy blend of black metal, industrial noise, and hardcore techgnosis turns your ear buds into ear enemies. The six-piece Japanese collective unbind brooding slabs of brutality from the Seventh Circle, abysmally vibrant terrors fine and dark.
