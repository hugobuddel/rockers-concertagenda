<p><strong>Escape-ism</strong> is the Found-Sound-Dream-Drama starring <strong>Ian Svenonius</strong> &amp; <strong>Alexandra Cabral</strong></p>
<p>Rock ‘n Roll revolutionary and punk veteran <strong>Ian Svenonius</strong> is back in town. The mythical performer, author, and filmmaker is currently taking the world by storm with his duo project <strong>Escape-Ism</strong>. Carrying only a guitar, microphone, an analogue-sounding drum machine and tape deck, <strong>Escape-Ism</strong> reinvents rock ’n’ roll the same way the jet engine reinvented travel; ripping up the stage to tiny, little bits.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Svenonius</strong> hasn’t written a basic <em>‘How to Make It in the Music Business’</em> book. Rather, the writer, online talk show host and, most important, singer in a series of breathtaking rock ‘n’ roll bands (<strong>Nation of Ulysses</strong>, <strong>the Make-Up</strong>, <strong>Chain &amp; the Gang</strong>), is drawing a line in the sand and doing so with what he hopes will finally define the undefinable.”</p>

<strong><em>‘Against the Written Word’</em></strong> is the most important, most revolutionary book produced since the advent of the printing press; the book that will liberate readers from reading, writers from writing, and booksellers from peddling their despicable wares. This book ushers in a new era of freedom from reading and all its attendant bedfellows such as Enlightenment thinking and the mass alienation wrought by the phonetic alphabet. <strong><em>‘Against the Written Word’</em> </strong>will be a tremendous best seller and simultaneously the last book that anyone will read.</p>
<p>With nineteen essays ripping, shredding, tearing apart all the bugaboos that haunt humanity nowadays,<strong><em> ‘Against the Written Word’</em> </strong>is a must-read for any aspiring radical or would-be gnostic who has a penchant for words, thought, clothes, intoxicants, music, art, expression, etc. The work is presented in a range of writing: essays, screenplays, lectures, sci-fi stories, and manifestos, with topics that include <em>“the rise of incorporated man,”</em> <em>“tourism as the neoliberal mode of military occupation,”</em> a workshop on songwriting for the purpose of suggestion and mind control, and many more.</p>
