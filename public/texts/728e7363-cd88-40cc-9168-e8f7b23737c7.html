<p>“The delicacy extended by enmossed to all their endeavours, outputs, and connections speaks of an explicit non-extractive stance to life, music, friendship, the commons and the DIY-cultures that run through these informal networks. enmossed has introduced the scene to a breadth of inspiring musicians, offering some of their most thought-provoking pieces – always not-for-profit, where proceeds go to great causes such as the Women’s Law Project, Afrorack, and the Carolina Abortion Fund. We are humbled to be able to welcome representatives of enmossed in July.”</p>
<p>5 YRS ZENEVLOED</p>
<p>Zenevloed has grown over the past years to be an international, transdisciplinary<br>
collective. We have continued to dedicate ourselves to presenting experimental music and art globally, in fitting contexts, reaching out to defining presences in the scene – based on qualitative output rather than amounts of clicks. Adhering to collaborative DIY/DIT ethics, networks have blossomed into friendships. In our 5 year anniversary we hone these connections by inviting close collaborators to exchange during concerts, radio shows, and events this year. And, as always, we will not get chased into the death drive of ‘performing’ in the scene.</p>
<p>Noise / Industrial / Ambient / Rhythmic</p>
<p>Glyn Maier (US)<br>
is a sound artist and field recordist living in Pisgah Forest, North Carolina, USA.</p>
<p>Non-city outdoor spaces are essential to Maier’s practice. With a formal education in physics and music composition, Maier’s preoccupations with natural objects, landscapes, and their social histories guide his recordings, which are then integrated into ambient electronic works utilising organic rhythms and complex timbres. Maier’s abstract synthesis work is deeply informed by sound design, but his larger focus is on the agency of both machine and environment.</p>
<p>Another facet of Maier’s sonic practice is enmossed, the label he founded in 2017. Dedicated to contemporary sound, all profits are donated to positive causes of the artist’s choice, and materials for the tapes and records are hand-constructed out of recycled materials.</p>
<p>Patrick Gallagher (US)<br>
is a sound artist currently based in Philadelphia, USA. With an education in mathematics, Gallagher employs generative/algorithmic processes, guided improvisation, and intuitive sound collage in an effort to weave evocative and evolving sonic narratives. Exploring the various developments of 20th century composition and contemporary computer music, he seeks to fuse that technicality with the cathartic and rapturous nature of the DIY noise underground. Previous works employed a wide range of sound sources – synthesisers, field recordings, tabletop guitar, etc. – however, Gallagher currently focuses almost entirely on digital synthesis, particularly additive and granular techniques.</p>
<p>Gallagher has released albums on cassette and vinyl through ENxPL (enmossed x Psychic Liberation), Hot Releases, Refulgent Sepulchre, Tone Log, and other independent labels.</p>
<p>BAGLOVER (CAN/NL)<br>
Baglover performs live noise, power electronics and industrial, using analog synths, field recordings, contact mics, with vocals sung in Dutch, French, German and English. They collaborated with Legowelt under the moniker Star Shepherd resulting in a tape on Nightwind Records described as ‘sing-a-long existentialist exotica to power-noise ambient to woolly hypnotic saturated melodies, a new dawn in lo-fi counter culture synthesis.’</p>
