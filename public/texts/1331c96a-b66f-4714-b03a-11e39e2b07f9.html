<p>Nu Punk een verdienmodel geworden is via de mainstream kanalen is het einde weer helemaal zoek. Geen knollen voor citroenen, 4 oude punkbands en dan nog een stuk of wat jonge punkbands erbij. Fuck it, rock it.</p>
<p>KRUST WORTHY: Hailing from Basingstoke, UK, Krust Worthy is the side project of guitarist and songwriter Neil Duncan (of Rhi &amp; The Relics and GeezaPunx, and the chief editor of IssuePunkZine). In 2021 Krust Worthy contributed the awesome track ‘Sab The Hunters’ (with Alex Bar Rat on vocals) to the acclaimed ‘Hunt Sabs Benefit, Vol. 3’ compilation-CD, which also includes well known names s.a. MDC, Rubella Ballet and The Cravats. Nowadays the duo features Neil on guitars and vocals, and drummer (Danny Webster. Danny is a current member of Rhi &amp; The Relics and GeezaPunx, and a former well known professional skateboarder ánd short time drummer for The Anti-Nowhere League.)</p>
<p>SCOUNDRELS: Hailing from the south of the Netherlands, Scoundrels originally were around (with various line-ups) between 1979 and 1990, During those years they released a sought after cassette and two outstanding LP’s. Singer, guitarist and songwriter Patrick Delabie (also owner of the famous Studio 195) and drummer Bootsy (a.k.a. Belgian cult multi-media artist Butsenzeller) reactivated the band in 2021. After recruiting their new bass player Wim IJff, Scoundrels recorded the highly recommended LP ‘Oh No! Not Again!’ (for Gram Records, 2022) and played numerous gigs in Holland as well as Belgium.</p>
<p>FORD’S FUZZ INFERNO: Guitarists Hans F. Ford and Patrick Delabie have known each other since the very early ’80s, when their ancient bands Waste and Scoundrels frequently gigged together in Holland and Belgium. In 1990 they first joined forces in the eclectic freak-punk-noise-psych-pop-jazz-whatever unit Betty Ford Clinic, which lasted till 1995. Several years/bands/projects later, in January 2021 to be more precise, they founded the hi-energy fuzz-punk duo Ford’s Fuzz Inferno, for which Patrick shifted to drums. Up till now they’ve released five blistering 7″ EP’s (number six is due for May 2023) and a compilation-CD, and they aren’t done yet. On stage the band will perform as a trio, with Hans and Patrick on guitars/vox, and Scoundrels drummer Bootsy taking care of drum duties.</p>
<p>RHI &amp; THE RELICS: Fronted by the ‘out of control’ Rhian Gove, Rhi &amp; The Relics have been tearing the roofs off punk venues in and around Basingstoke for quite some years already, and it’s easy to understand why they are such a popular live attraction. Their contribution to the ‘Compulsive Agitation’ EP marks the band’s awaited vinyl-debut. The current line-up comprises Rhian Gove, Neil Duncan (guitar and songwriting, als see the Krust Worthy info above), bass player Del Thompson (also of GeezaPunx) and drummer Danny Webster. (Also see the short Krust Worthy info above.)</p>
