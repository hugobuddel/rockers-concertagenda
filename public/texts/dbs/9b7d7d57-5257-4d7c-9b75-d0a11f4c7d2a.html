<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Another</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The greatest UK/Russian collaboration since the Second World War, One<br>
Another are a Utrecht-based post-punk/darkwave duo comprised of Sam Rink<br>
and Laurie Rae. Formed in 2022 and inspired by the likes of Drab<br>
Majesty, Aphex Twin, Cocteau Twins and John Maus, they present a<br>
genre-bending musical experience. This is their first ever live concert<br>
to support the release of their upcoming EP “The Chasm”.</p>



<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kboy en de goedzo jongens</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You may or may not know kboy en de goedzo jongens from their debut EP<br>
MUKUS MENSENSLIJM. Or maybe you know them from that time they bummed a<br>
ciggie off you. This childish post-punk band (which means shouting about<br>
boobs etc.) is a big fan of artists like The Garden, The B-52’s, Kleenex<br>
and Cake. Are you a fan of those bands as well and do you have somewhat<br>
low standards? Then come and have a look!!</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Quincy &amp; The David</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Quincy &amp; The David are a DIY band from Zwolle. For fans of (post) punk,<br>
songs that don’t exceed 3 minutes, mosh pits and screaming, combined<br>
with a sound inspired by The Cure, Goat Girl and Fontaines DC. The final<br>
ingredient is lyrics like finding out all your heroes from back in the<br>
day are sexist and whether or not they dare to wear makeup. You can hear<br>
all these ingredients on their debut album Purple Moon, Yellow Sun.</p>
