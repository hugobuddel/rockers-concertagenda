<div>YE BANISHED PRIVATEERS takes you 300 years back in time for an imaginary journey through the harsh life at sea during the early 18th century. With songs inspired by traditional Irish and Scandinavian folk music, acting and elaborate historical clothing the Privateers tell a story about the rough sailor’s life, lived on the other side of the law– and the fight against oppression and nationalism.</div>
<div>The mix of rude folk and punk music invites you to dance and sing along, while the gripping ballads will make the toughest pirate heart soft.</div>
