<div>Sunburn Surf Fest<p></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether you associate surf music with the Southern<br>
Californian beaches of the early 60s, the absurd crime and violence of<br>
Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction or perhaps with the James Bond theme even. Surf<br>
music is simply too cool to care.<br>
So put on your hippest aloha shirt and come over for some scorching hot<br>
surf bands!</p>

<h3>The Krontjong Devil</h3>
<div>
Straight from ‘Surf City Groningen’, a name borrowed from a broadcast of<br>
the late TV program Lola Da Musica, the Krontjong Devils have been<br>
throwing some marvellous instrumental surf music over the years. All<br>
following the recipe: sun, sea, Southern California and Dick Dale. And<br>
yet, there’s no pigeonholing the K-Devils!<br>

<h3>
The Wave Chargers</h3>
<div>
These four rock n’ rollers have been involved in the Parisian<br>
underground scene since 2015, giving a fashionable spin to authentic<br>
surf music. The dexterity of their guitar-playing and their wild live<br>
shows, often including a skilled go-go dancer, have brought them to<br>
notorious stages, opening for artists including The Flamin’ Groovies,<br>
The 5.6.7.8’s or King Khan &amp; the Shrines.<br>
Beware, there may be some go-go dancing involved.<br>

<h3>Baríton Loco</h3>
<div>
Baríton Loco brings the rawness and finesse back from the instrumental<br>
50s and 60s and don’t try to hide their history in the heavier music<br>
genres. Think of the sound of Link Wray, the attitude of The Cramps and<br>
the class of Mancini.<br>
Not for the faint of heart!<br>

<h3>The Malbehavers</h3>
<div>
From the beaches of Tilburg, these locals like to throw a sonic beach<br>
party, inspired by their surf heroes. Instrumental surf music from the<br>
days when ponytails were still worn high on the head, swimming trunks<br>
were still fitting tight around the scrotum, and when you could still<br>
shamelessly shake your hips on the dance floor.<br>
