<p>Up The Irons is a well-known name in both the Iron Maiden realm as in “tribute-land” worldwide. Packing more than 15 years of experience, the band has done loads of shows everywhere in the world. Up The Irons consists of five very experienced Maiden maniacs, which is a guarantee for an explosive, high-energy performance. All the Iron Maiden blockbuster hits, combined with other fan-favourites, makes Up The Irons the ultimate Iron Maiden Tribute band for both the casual rock-fan as well as the hardcore, rabid Maiden fans that the bandmembers are themselves.</p>
<p>Make sure to witness the best you can get, and maybe Eddie will join you for a snack as well…</p>
<p>Some examples of the more memorable shows are tours with Paul Di’Anno, playing Graspop Metal Meeting in 2006 and 2015 (for an estimated crowd of 25.000 metal maniacs!), touring Italy, France, Belgium, Germany and the UK besides Holland, being supported by Lauren Harris and many more. Not by any means downplaying the fact that the band still massively enjoys playing gigs anywhere, anytime in any country!</p>
<p>Highlights:<br>
Up The Irons was founded in 1999 in Tilburg, the Netherlands. They have toured with former Iron Maiden singer Paul Di’Anno as a special guest to their shows, and Dennis Stratton (guitarist on the first Iron Maiden album) played a full set with Up The Irons on the Maiden Day 2016. Lauren Harris, daughter of Iron Maiden bass-player Steve Harris, supported Up The Irons with her ‘Lauren Harris Band’.</p>
<p>Up The Irons headlined a couple of Iron Maiden Fan Club Conventions in Holland. Steve Harris (Iron Maiden Bass-player) visited an Up The Irons show (Nov. 2006) and gave lots of compliments to the band.</p>
<p>The band got invited for the regular Maiden football-matches, which are organised by Steve Harris himself, for a couple of times when Maiden was playing in Holland.</p>
