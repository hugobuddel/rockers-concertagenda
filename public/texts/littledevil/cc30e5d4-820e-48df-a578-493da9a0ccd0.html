<h3>Burial Remains</h3>
<p><em>Old School Death Metal from The Netherlands feat. current and ex-members of Grim Fate, God Dethroned</em></p>
<p data-encore-id="type">Dutch brutal force BURIAL REMAINS spews forth old school death metal the Swedish way. Formed in 2017 to honor the legacy of ENTOMBED, DISMEMBER, GRAVE and CARNAGE, the band quickly grew into an entity of its own, playing leading underground events like Pitfest, Schoonebeek Deathfest and Drachten Deathfest.</p>
<p data-encore-id="type">With ‘Trinity Of Deception’ (2019), the band gained the attention of the international metal underground, having Sven (R.I.P.) of the mighty FLESHCRAWL performing vocal duties on the album. The year 2019 saw bassplayer Henk (formerly of GOD DETHRONED and ENTRAPMENT) joining the ranks followed by the release of ‘Spawn Of Chaos’ by the infamous Raw Skull Recordz. With the second album, the band stepped up their game, delivering an even more ferocious piece of HM2-ridden depravity.</p>
<p data-encore-id="type">In 2021, the band paid tribute to their fallen friend Sven by releasing the ‘As Blood Rains From The Sky’-EP, that includes a cover version of the eponymous FLESHCRAWL-classic as well as a brand new song. While continuing to play selective shows, the band has commenced writing the third album and prepares for the next chapter of chaos!</p>
<h3>Necrotesque</h3>
<p data-encore-id="type">The Dutch band Necrotesque; a composition of the words “necrotic” and “grotesque”, was founded in the spring of 2021. Arjan Jansen (Into The Arcane, ex-Dead End, ex-Prima Nocte, ex-Myosotis) and Dave Blummel (Into The Arcane, ex-Shakin’ Stars) had a common urge to play uncompromising Death Metal and wanted to shape this by starting a new band.</p>
<p data-encore-id="type">The guitar parts were ready, the band name had been in the back of the frontman’s Jansen mind for years. We sat down and the visual concept was fully thought out. The only thing that Jansen and Blummel had to do was find suitable people to complete the band. This had happened soon enough.</p>
<p data-encore-id="type">In Harald Bouten (Pictura Poesis, Daemonos, ex-Dead End, Into The Arcane), a drummer with whom Jansen and Blummel have been friends for many years, the first addition of Necrotesque was found. Finally, Lodewijk van Doorn (ex-Plague) completed the line-up with his deep low grunts.</p>
<p data-encore-id="type">Necrotesque is Death Metal. Just Death Metal! With musicians who have a combined background in Death metal, Doom, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Black Metal and Thrash, the result is groovy and swinging. No unnecessary fuss, guitar solos or breakdowns. Straightforward chainsaw metal to go wild in the moshpit. Inspired by bands like Grave, Bolt Thrower, Asphyx and Entombed.</p>
<p data-encore-id="type">Necrotesque is: – Lodewijk van Doorn / vocals – Arjan Jansen / guitar – Dave Blummel / bass – Harald Bouten / drums</p>
