<h3>Nebula</h3>
<p>Guitarist Eddie Glass and drummer Ruben Romano formed NEBULA in 1997 after breaking away from desert rock pioneers Fu Manchu, eventually recruiting bassist Mark Abshire. The power trio specializes in feedback-drenched heavy rock, incorporating liberal doses of Black Sabbath riffery, psychedelia, and space rock. The band released a number of EPs before moving onto full-length albums like 1999’s To the Center and 2001’s Charged. They’ve mainly distinguished themselves as a very hard-working live unit</p>
<p>NEBULA creates pure guitar-driven, conscious expanding rock for the 21st century. They are a culmination of their rock forbearers such as Jimi Hendrix, MC5, The Stooges and Mudhoney turned up a notch, taken to the next level and blasting through space. NEBULA spread their gospel through their music and what they are preaching will leave the congregation on the floor.</p>
<p>In 2017 the band decided to reissue three of their crucial early works via Heavy Psych Sounds Records: 1998’s Let it Burn, 1999’s To the Center and 2002’s Dos EPs, which includes the material originally released on 1999’s Sun Creature and a Nebula/Lowrider split.</p>
<p>Followed by the re-release of NEBULA’s Charged and the special release of Demos &amp; Outtakes ’98-02 in early 2019, in the summer of 2020, after 13 years the band returned with not only a new line-up but also with a brand new full-length called Holy Shit – 9 tracks of pure HEAVY PSYCH explosion !!!</p>
<h3>Duel</h3>
<p>DUEL is heavy psychedelic stoner doom metal from Austin, Texas. Hugely influenced by the darker sounds of early 70’s Proto-metal. Features two ex Scorpion Child (Nuclear Blast)members. Their sound is menacing and brutally old school. Total purists, their tunes cut right to the bone with heavy, deep groove and blistering tone. Tough and Loud! Hard rock as it should be!</p>
