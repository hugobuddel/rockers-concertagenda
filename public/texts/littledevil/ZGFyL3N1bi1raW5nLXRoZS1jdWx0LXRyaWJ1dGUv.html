<p>Put on your shades, because Sun King comes to town. With a suitcase full of classic covers, we bring rays of that pure The Cult sound. “Revolution”, “Love Removal Machine” and “Nirvana” too. And of course “She Sells Sanctuary”, “Rise” and “Sweet Soul Sister” are some of the songs we’ll sing for you. All the way from the city of Zwolle, four Dutch guys are aiming for one goal. Call it post punk, call it glam metal or grunge. We call it rock ’n roll! We are Sun King. And you are invited.</p>
