<h3 align="justify">Danava</h3>
<p align="justify">From the very depths of hell rises the fury, wrath and rage of the entity known as Danava. Armed with only Nothing But Nothing, the quartet of messengers are prepared to deliver a collection of warnings into the streets of global unrest in this year of 2023.</p>
<p align="justify">In the 20th year of existence, Danava seek to deliver its singular sound of Hard Rock and Heavy Metal to a weary world imprisoned by struggle and strife. With hope in gathering strength and stamina through music, in order to maintain what our lives and imaginations are capable of together. As One. Only then can we rise together and create a life worth living in a world no one asked to be born into. Ride with them! It’s time to let loose and bring forth the new era of fluidity before we disappear in smoke!</p>
<p align="justify">“Danava are revved to full-tilt boogie, shaking heaven and earth with their new album “Nothing But Nothing”. It’s like a Rainbow/Dio/Thin Lizzy/Di’Anno era Maiden/70’s Priest milkshake-chock full of the ample chunks and swirl that is Danava! It’s pretty much set to show the current rock and roll universe how it’s done. As if they haven’t been doing exactly that all along.”<br>
– Mike Scheidt of YOB</p>
<p align="justify">“With immense personality, eccentricity and an energy of their own making; this is a shameless, wild and joyful celebration of all things heavy and rocking!”<br>
-Gottfried Åhman of PÅGÅ/ No Future/ In Solitude</p>
<p align="justify">“This is the best new album I’ve heard in years…a total masterpiece. It ticks every box for me; the songwriting, the musicianship…everything is just outstanding here. Nobody comes close to Danava when they’re this good.”<br>
-K.A. Starrs aka Uncle Acid</p>
<p align="justify">“What can I say about the new Danava album other than it ROCKS! Greg’s playing and singing have never been better and the band is on fire. They take their time with new music and it shows. This is a great album, and I recommend you take the time to give it a serious listen.”<br>
-Richard “Smokey” Taylor of Sorcery(Stunt Rock!)</p>
<p align="justify">“Uli Roth/Johnny Winter on good, no strychnine havin, speed. Not your old grandpappys rocknroll, this is tomorrow’s cooler than Tiktok classic. Golden, boys. (“early 80’s, like good Dio?” “No, closer to classical but I can’t put my finger on it”<br>
-Jerry A of Poison Idea</p>

<p><span>…is High Energy Fuzz‘n‘Roll</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since the release of their long sold out debut, WEDGE are an integral part of the European underground rock freak scene. Over a short time the group managed to establish a steadily growing fan base by playing over 400 shows since 2014 in numerous countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, Holland, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Poland, Czech Republic, Belgium, England, Greece, Israel and of course Germany. This includes famous festivals such as Bukta Open Air, Desert Fest, Stoned from the Underground,&nbsp;</span><span>Dana</span><span>&nbsp;Jam, Burg Herzberg Festival etc., and support gigs for bands such as Fu Manchu (US), Kadavar (DE), Blues Pills (SE), Orchid (US), The&nbsp;</span><span>Flying Eyes (US), Lucifer (UK), Pontiac (US), Simo (US), to name but a few.</span></p>
<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>
<p><span>WEDGE was born into the spotlight in 2014. The trio was founded in Berlin by guitarist/singer Kiryk Drewinski (ex-Liquid Visions &amp; ex-The Magnificent Brotherhood), drummer Holger “The Holg” Grosser &amp; bassist/organist Dave Götz and named itself after the first stone tool of human history.&nbsp;</span><span>Their sound is accordingly archaic, extremely effective, “made from solid rock” and, when used correctly, causes fire … especially live! WEDGE blends mainly elements of classic rock, 60s&nbsp;</span><span>garage and some Psychedelic with a proper dose of joy while playing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Even before the band decided on a name, their first studio album was recorded (originally planned to be a demo only) and released on the Italian label “Heavy Psych Sounds” in November 2014. The LP&nbsp;</span><span>sold out after a short time and was very popular among the dancers, as well as the&nbsp;</span><span>writers. Thus, the three multi-instrumentalists are frequently credited with refreshingly catchy&nbsp;</span><span>song writing, which outshines their peers of similar genre. This also gave WEDGE some radio&nbsp;</span><span>airplay early on. One of the group’s greatest strengths, however, is experienced live.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Their second album&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.wedgeband.com/media" target="_self" rel="noopener">“Killing Tongue”</a></span><span>&nbsp;saw it’s release in 2018 on Heavy Psych Sounds Records and was&nbsp;</span><span>companied by the&nbsp;</span><span>extensive&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.wedgeband.com/live" target="_self" rel="noopener">“Killing Tongue Tour”</a></span><span>&nbsp;which brought the band to over 50 cities across Germany &amp; Europe.<br><br>Their latest album&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wedgeband.com/media" target="_self" data-anchor="dataItem-kktucrkl" rel="noopener">“Like No Tomorrow”</a>&nbsp;was released on January 15th 2021.</span></p>
