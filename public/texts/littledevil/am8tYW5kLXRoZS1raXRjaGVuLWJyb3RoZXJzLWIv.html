<h3>Wucan</h3>
<p>Wucan is a german rock band from Dresden, who like to describe themselve as Heavy Flute Rock. If one is to dive deeper into the artistic creativity of the group, it becomes obvious, why regular genres won’t fit here. Multifaceted and playful they deliver psychedelic riffs, progressive song structures with folk elements here and there, since their first album. Wucan fears neither the soothing melodies, nor the tougher pace.</p>
<p>Reinventing themselve with every release, the band and it’s singer and multiinstrumentalist Francis tobolsky never looser their distinct features. Ranging from short proto-metal tracks to epic 15 minute tracks like “Wandersmann” of their debut album or „Aging 10 Years in 2 Seconds“ of their 2-LP follow up.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, while the musical landscape was forced in hibernation, Wucan put all their time and energy into unleashing their creativity in the local rehearsal room. In late spring 2022 their third studio album will finally surface and reveal another face of this ever-surprising band.</p>
<h3>Mojo and the Kitchen Brothers</h3>
<p>We are Mojo and the Kitchen Brothers. A 5-headed omnium gatherum of eclectically inspired music freaks from Belgium cooking up a late 60’s early 70’s minded mix of heavy progrock soaked in psychedelia. The smells emanating from our kitchen recall bands like Black Sabbath, Wishbone Ash and Pink Floyd. However, M&amp;TKB is more than a nostalgia trip. Firmly tuned into the spring of our contemporary psych rockers, Mojo &amp; the Kitchen Brothers’ catchy tunes, proggy riffs, deafening drums, roaring basslines and spacy, triple-guitar jams take the listener on a Janus-faced journey through the limbo between past and present.</p>
