      <strong>WORLD PEACE</strong> (hardcore/powerviolence, Oakland, California)
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re at all invested in powerviolence, the hardcore subgenre built
      around fast and jarring bursts of aggression, then these are boom times.
      The Bay Area’s history of powerviolence runs deep with such bands as
      <strong>Spazz</strong>, <strong>Godstomper</strong>, and
      <strong>No Le$$</strong> all coming from the Northern California region.
      is a kinda new band presenting their brand of low end violence. Featuring
      no guitars and track lengths averaging 30 seconds,
      <strong>WP</strong> examine the co-dependency of man and god through a
      “less is more” sonic approach. Elements of bands like
      <strong>Water Torture</strong>, <strong>Vaccine</strong>, and even
      <strong>Sissy Spacek</strong> can be detected, but this Oakland
      three-piece craft a sound wholly their own.

    <p><strong>XIAO</strong> (hardcore/powerviolence, Stokholm, Sweden)</p>
    <p>
      Forming in the summer of 2019, is a Swedish hardcore band based out of
      Stockholm. The group is bringing forth a sound that can go from the
      hurried pacing of D-beat and power violence one moment, and slower and
      measured the next.

        >“It’s a mishmash of hardcore worship over the ages, we’re mostly
        inspired by early to mid-’00s bands like <strong>Mind Eraser</strong>,
        <strong>Coke Bust</strong>, <strong>Hatred Surge</strong>, and then some
        random stuff like <strong>Dismember</strong>,
        <strong>Minor Threat</strong>, and <strong>Converge</strong>. We like to
        let all of our inspirations peak through when writing songs!”</em

      (<strong>No Echo</strong> interview). In other words; fast, intense, in
      your face hardcore/powerviolence/d-beat all the way from Stockholm.
      <strong>XIAO</strong> is a band not to be missed, delivering great shows
      all over Europe the last two years.
