      PAIN is an industrial metal project created by Peter Tägtgren, a Swedish
      musician, multi-instrumentalist, and producer. If you want to hear this
      story from him, it would be short and straight to the point: “PAIN was
      just me f*cking around in the studio, and it grew into becoming a band”.
    </p>

      Started as a one-man project with all the vocals, instruments parts, and
      production made by one person… Well, it still is, but not only. It also
      became a prominent touring group that today consists of, apart from Peter,
      his son Sebastian Tägtgren (drums), Jonathan Olsson (bass), and Sebastian
      Svalland (guitar).

      Nevertheless, a long time ago, in 1997, when the debut album of the
      project was released, there was nobody but Peter. By this time, he already
      had four successful albums with Hypocrisy – and also had some ideas that
      wouldn’t go with the band’s style.

      That’s how the story of PAIN began – the story where 8 albums are known
      and loved for such smashing hits as ‘End Of The Line’, ‘Shut Your Mouth’,
      ‘Same Old Song’, ‘Follow Me’, ‘Coming Home’ and many more. This story also
      contains strong lyrics, rich arrangements, solid melodies, unflagging
      energy, killing live shows, and big plans for the future.
